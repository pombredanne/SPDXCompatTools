The LaTeX Project Public License<br/>
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
<p>LPPL Version 1.2  1999-09-03</p>
<p>Copyright 1999 LaTeX3 Project<br/>
    Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this<br/>
    license document, but modification of it is not allowed.</p>
<p><br/>
PREAMBLE<br/>
========</p>
<p>The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the<br/>
base LaTeX distribution is distributed.</p>
<p>You may use this license for any program that you have written and wish<br/>
to distribute.  This license may be particularly suitable if your<br/>
program is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it<br/>
even if your program is unrelated to TeX.  The section `WHETHER AND HOW<br/>
TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE&apos;, below, gives instructions,<br/>
examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering<br/>
distributing their programs under this license.</p>
<p>In this license document, `The Program&apos; refers to any program<br/>
distributed under this license.</p>
<p>This license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed<br/>
and conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be<br/>
distributed.  Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary<br/>
and/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the<br/>
distribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The<br/>
Program may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the<br/>
distribution of an unmodified copy of the file.  A distributor wishing<br/>
to distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore<br/>
needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.</p>
<p>Activities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program<br/>
are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In<br/>
particular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.</p>
<p>We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you<br/>
the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program<br/>
that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while<br/>
maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of<br/>
The Program.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while <br/>
meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex&apos;<br/>
in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.</p>
<p><br/>
CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br/>
===========================================</p>
<p>You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program.<br/>
Distribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.</p>
<p>You may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal<br/>
notice forbidding modification of that file.</p>
<p>You may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the<br/>
following eight conditions are met:</p>
<p>  1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the<br/>
     distribution of a modified version of the file as described below<br/>
     in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of<br/>
     The Program&apos;.</p>
<p>  2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any<br/>
     applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified<br/>
     version of the file that are described below in the subsection<br/>
     `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&apos;.</p>
<p>  3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the<br/>
     original file.</p>
<p>  4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and<br/>
     name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program<br/>
     which contains it.</p>
<p>  5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate<br/>
     clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.</p>
<p>  6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the<br/>
     reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to<br/>
     ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original<br/>
     maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified<br/>
     files.</p>
<p>  7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids<br/>
     distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived<br/>
     from the modified file with the filename of the original file.</p>
<p>  8. You must do either (A) or (B):</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">       (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete,<br/>
           unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified<br/>
           file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by<br/>
           offering access to copy the modified file from a designated<br/>
           place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program<br/>
           from the same place meets this condition, even though third<br/>
           parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the<br/>
           modified file;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">       (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information<br/>
           that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program;<br/>
           for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)<br/>
           for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of <br/>
           The Program free of charge (either the version from which<br/>
           your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).</p>
<p>Note that in the above, `distribution&apos; of a file means making the<br/>
file available to others by any means.  This includes, for instance,<br/>
installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is<br/>
accessible by users other than yourself.  `Modification&apos; of a file<br/>
means any procedure that produces a derivative file under any<br/>
applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or<br/>
a significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications<br/>
and/or translated into another language.</p>
<p>Changing the name of a file (other than as necessitated by the file<br/>
conventions of the target file systems) is considered to be a<br/>
modification of the file.</p>
<p>The distribution conditions in this license do not have to be<br/>
applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the<br/>
above conditions.  Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to<br/>
any such modified file.</p>
<p>The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not<br/>
apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes<br/>
identical to the latest version of that file of The Program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>It is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own<br/>
personal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for<br/>
distributing the modified file.  While you might intend that such<br/>
modified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by<br/>
accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may<br/>
not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file<br/>
that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of<br/>
this license.  It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy<br/>
of The Program identical with the public one.  Many programs provide<br/>
ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its<br/>
licensed files.</p>
<p><br/>
Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>An individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that<br/>
supplement and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only<br/>
if, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the<br/>
file or distribution of a modified version of the file.  The conditions<br/>
on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with<br/>
respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that<br/>
is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions<br/>
of those files.</p>
<p><br/>
Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files<br/>
---------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is,<br/>
if it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional<br/>
conditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions<br/>
above, apply to the file according to its filename extension:</p>
<p>  - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins&apos; since<br/>
    these are installation files containing the legal notices that are<br/>
    placed in the files they generate.</p>
<p>  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename<br/>
    extension `.fd&apos; (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard<br/>
    conditions of the LPPL as described above.  You may also distribute<br/>
    such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names<br/>
    provided that:<br/>
    (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of<br/>
        available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;<br/>
    (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input<br/>
        paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition<br/>
        files is actually used by TeX).</p>
<p>  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename<br/>
    extension `.cfg&apos; (configuration files) with their original names.<br/>
    The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands<br/>
    that are allowed in a particular configuration file.</p>
<p>Because of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software,<br/>
The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of<br/>
components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them,<br/>
but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.</p>
<p><br/>
NO WARRANTY<br/>
===========</p>
<p>There is no warranty for The Program.  Except when otherwise stated in<br/>
writing, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is&apos;, without<br/>
warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not<br/>
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for<br/>
a particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance<br/>
of The Program is with you.  Should The Program prove defective, you<br/>
assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.</p>
<p>In no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or<br/>
any author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may<br/>
distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted above, be liable to<br/>
you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or<br/>
consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of<br/>
inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of<br/>
data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as<br/>
a result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other<br/>
programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other<br/>
party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p><br/>
WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE<br/>
=========================================================</p>
<p>This section contains important instructions, examples, and<br/>
recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their<br/>
programs under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you&apos; in<br/>
this section.</p>
<p><br/>
Choosing This License or Another License<br/>
----------------------------------------</p>
<p>If for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution*<br/>
conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to<br/>
this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your<br/>
program under a different license.  You may use the text of this license<br/>
as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to<br/>
the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is<br/>
distributed under the LPPL.</p>
<p>The document `modguide.tex&apos; in the base LaTeX distribution explains<br/>
the motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,<br/>
for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public<br/>
License (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your program is<br/>
unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex&apos; may still be<br/>
relevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any<br/>
license are encouraged to read it.</p>
<p><br/>
How to Use This License<br/>
-----------------------</p>
<p>To use this license, place in each of the files of your program both<br/>
an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also<br/>
a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is<br/>
constrained by the conditions in this license.</p>
<p>Here is an example of such a notice and statement:</p>
<p>  %% pig.dtx<br/>
  %% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name<br/>
  %<br/>
  % This program may be distributed and/or modified under the<br/>
  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.2<br/>
  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.<br/>
  % The latest version of this license is in<br/>
  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt<br/>
  % and version 1.2 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX <br/>
  % version 1999/12/01 or later.<br/>
  %<br/>
  % This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins</p>
<p>Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in<br/>
this license document would apply, with `The Program&apos; referring to the<br/>
two files `pig.dtx&apos; and `pig.ins&apos;, and `The Copyright Holder&apos; referring<br/>
to the person `M. Y. Name&apos;.</p>
<p><br/>
Important Recommendations<br/>
-------------------------</p>
<p> Defining What Constitutes The Program</p>
<p>   The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the<br/>
   files of The Program.  It is therefore important that you provide a<br/>
   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program.<br/>
   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the<br/>
   files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by<br/>
   using a line like</p>
<p>    % This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.</p>
<p>   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be<br/>
   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you<br/>
   to comprise The Program.</p>
<p> Noting Exceptional Files</p>
<p>   If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on<br/>
   modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those<br/>
   files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX<br/>
   Software Files&apos;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a<br/>
   prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either<br/>
   lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of<br/>
   exceptional files.</p>
<p>   Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are<br/>
   often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on<br/>
   modification.  LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension<br/>
   `.cfg&apos;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions<br/>
   on the distribution of a modified version of the file.  The<br/>
   additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples <br/>
   of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional<br/>
   conditions.</p>

PREAMBLE<br/>
========</p>
<p>The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the<br/>

<p>You may use this license for any program that you have written and wish<br/>
to distribute.  This license may be particularly suitable if your<br/>

The Program.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while <br/>
meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex&apos;<br/>
in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.</p>
<p><br/>
CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br/>
===========================================</p>
<p>You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program.<br/>
Distribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.</p>
<p>You may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal<br/>
notice forbidding modification of that file.</p>
<p>You may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the<br/>
following eight conditions are met:</p>
<p>  1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the<br/>
     distribution of a modified version of the file as described below<br/>
     in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of<br/>
     The Program&apos;.</p>
<p>  2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any<br/>
     applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified<br/>
     version of the file that are described below in the subsection<br/>
     `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files&apos;.</p>
<p>  3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the<br/>
     original file.</p>
<p>  4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and<br/>
     name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program<br/>
     which contains it.</p>
<p>  5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate<br/>
     clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.</p>
<p>  6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the<br/>
     reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to<br/>
     ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original<br/>
     maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified<br/>
     files.</p>
<p>  7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids<br/>
     distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived<br/>
     from the modified file with the filename of the original file.</p>
<p>  8. You must do either (A) or (B):</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">       (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete,<br/>
           unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified<br/>
           file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by<br/>
           offering access to copy the modified file from a designated<br/>
           place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program<br/>
           from the same place meets this condition, even though third<br/>
           parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the<br/>
           modified file;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">       (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information<br/>
           that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program;<br/>
           for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)<br/>
           for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of <br/>
           The Program free of charge (either the version from which<br/>
           your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).</p>
<p>Note that in the above, `distribution&apos; of a file means making the<br/>
file available to others by any means.  This includes, for instance,<br/>
installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is<br/>
accessible by users other than yourself.  `Modification&apos; of a file<br/>
means any procedure that produces a derivative file under any<br/>
applicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or<br/>
a significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications<br/>
and/or translated into another language.</p>
<p>Changing the name of a file (other than as necessitated by the file<br/>
conventions of the target file systems) is considered to be a<br/>
modification of the file.</p>
<p>The distribution conditions in this license do not have to be<br/>
applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the<br/>
above conditions.  Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to<br/>
any such modified file.</p>
<p>The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not<br/>
apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes<br/>
identical to the latest version of that file of The Program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>It is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own<br/>
personal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for<br/>
distributing the modified file.  While you might intend that such<br/>
modified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by<br/>
accident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may<br/>
not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file<br/>
that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of<br/>
this license.  It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy<br/>
of The Program identical with the public one.  Many programs provide<br/>
ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its<br/>
licensed files.</p>
<p><br/>
Additional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>An individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that<br/>
supplement and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only<br/>
if, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the<br/>
file or distribution of a modified version of the file.  The conditions<br/>
on individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with<br/>
respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that<br/>
is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions<br/>
of those files.</p>
<p><br/>
Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files<br/>
---------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is,<br/>
if it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional<br/>
conditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions<br/>
above, apply to the file according to its filename extension:</p>
<p>  - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins&apos; since<br/>
    these are installation files containing the legal notices that are<br/>
    placed in the files they generate.</p>
<p>  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename<br/>
    extension `.fd&apos; (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard<br/>
    conditions of the LPPL as described above.  You may also distribute<br/>
    such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names<br/>
    provided that:<br/>
    (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of<br/>
        available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;<br/>
    (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input<br/>
        paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition<br/>
        files is actually used by TeX).</p>
<p>  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename<br/>
    extension `.cfg&apos; (configuration files) with their original names.<br/>
    The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands<br/>
    that are allowed in a particular configuration file.</p>
<p>Because of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software,<br/>
The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of<br/>
components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them,<br/>
but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.</p>
<p><br/>
NO WARRANTY<br/>
===========</p>
<p>There is no warranty for The Program.  Except when otherwise stated in<br/>
writing, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is&apos;, without<br/>
warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not<br/>
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for<br/>
a particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance<br/>
of The Program is with you.  Should The Program prove defective, you<br/>
assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.</p>
<p>In no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or<br/>
any author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may<br/>
distribute and/or modify The Program as permitted above, be liable to<br/>
you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or<br/>
consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of<br/>
inability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of<br/>
data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as<br/>
a result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other<br/>
programs), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other<br/>
party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p><br/>
WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE<br/>
=========================================================</p>
<p>This section contains important instructions, examples, and<br/>
recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their<br/>
programs under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you&apos; in<br/>
this section.</p>
<p><br/>
Choosing This License or Another License<br/>
----------------------------------------</p>
<p>If for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution*<br/>
conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to<br/>
this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your<br/>
program under a different license.  You may use the text of this license<br/>
as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to<br/>
the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is<br/>
distributed under the LPPL.</p>
<p>The document `modguide.tex&apos; in the base LaTeX distribution explains<br/>
the motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,<br/>
for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public<br/>
License (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your program is<br/>
unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex&apos; may still be<br/>
relevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any<br/>
license are encouraged to read it.</p>
<p><br/>
How to Use This License<br/>
-----------------------</p>
<p>To use this license, place in each of the files of your program both<br/>
an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also<br/>
a statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is<br/>
constrained by the conditions in this license.</p>
<p>Here is an example of such a notice and statement:</p>
<p>  %% pig.dtx<br/>
  %% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name<br/>
  %<br/>
  % This program may be distributed and/or modified under the<br/>
  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.2<br/>
  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.<br/>
  % The latest version of this license is in<br/>
  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt<br/>
  % and version 1.2 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX <br/>
  % version 1999/12/01 or later.<br/>
  %<br/>
  % This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins</p>
<p>Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in<br/>
this license document would apply, with `The Program&apos; referring to the<br/>
two files `pig.dtx&apos; and `pig.ins&apos;, and `The Copyright Holder&apos; referring<br/>
to the person `M. Y. Name&apos;.</p>
<p><br/>
Important Recommendations<br/>
-------------------------</p>
<p> Defining What Constitutes The Program</p>
<p>   The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the<br/>
   files of The Program.  It is therefore important that you provide a<br/>
   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program.<br/>
   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the<br/>
   files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by<br/>
   using a line like</p>
<p>    % This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.</p>
<p>   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be<br/>
   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you<br/>
   to comprise The Program.</p>
<p> Noting Exceptional Files</p>
<p>   If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on<br/>
   modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those<br/>
   files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX<br/>
   Software Files&apos;), then it is recommended that The Program contain a<br/>
   prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either<br/>
   lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of<br/>
   exceptional files.</p>
<p>   Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are<br/>
   often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on<br/>
   modification.  LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension<br/>
   `.cfg&apos;) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions<br/>
   on the distribution of a modified version of the file.  The<br/>
   additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples <br/>
   of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional<br/>
   conditions.</p>
