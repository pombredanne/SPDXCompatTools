## ODC Open Database License (ODbL)
<p>### Preamble</p>
<p>The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to<br/>
allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while<br/>
maintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by<br/>
copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some<br/>
jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that<br/>
cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally,<br/>
the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to<br/>
act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.</p>
<p>Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,<br/>
audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),<br/>
and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the<br/>
contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL<br/>
together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a<br/>
single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the<br/>
contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should<br/>
describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual<br/>
record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply. </p>
<p>Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be<br/>
covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,<br/>
trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights<br/>
over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may<br/>
have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing<br/>
activities not covered by this License.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>The Licensor (as defined below) </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>You (as defined below) </p>
<p>agree as follows: </p>
<p>### 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words</p>
<p>&quot;Collective Database&quot; – Means this Database in unmodified form as part<br/>
of a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are<br/>
assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective<br/>
Database will not be considered a Derivative Database.</p>
<p>&quot;Convey&quot; – As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database,<br/>
or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables<br/>
a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative<br/>
Database.  Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a<br/>
computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no<br/>
transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.<br/>
&quot;Contents&quot; – The contents of this Database, which includes the<br/>
information, independent works, or other material collected into the<br/>
Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual<br/>
data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.</p>
<p>&quot;Database&quot; – A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a<br/>
systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic<br/>
or other means offered under the terms of this License.</p>
<p>&quot;Database Directive&quot; – Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European<br/>
Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection<br/>
of databases, as amended or succeeded.</p>
<p>&quot;Database Right&quot; – Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (&quot;sui<br/>
generis&quot;) rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed<br/>
by member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of<br/>
the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar<br/>
rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4. </p>
<p>&quot;Derivative Database&quot; – Means a database based upon the Database, and<br/>
includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any<br/>
other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the<br/>
Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or<br/>
Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new<br/>
Database.</p>
<p>&quot;Extraction&quot; – Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a<br/>
Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in<br/>
any form.</p>
<p>&quot;License&quot; – Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights<br/>
such as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.</p>
<p>&quot;Licensor&quot; – Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms<br/>
of this License. </p>
<p>&quot;Person&quot; – Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons<br/>
corporate or incorporate.</p>
<p>&quot;Produced Work&quot; –  a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text,<br/>
or sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the<br/>
Contents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative<br/>
Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.  </p>
<p>&quot;Publicly&quot; – means to Persons other than You or under Your control by<br/>
either more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their<br/>
activities (such as contracting with an independent consultant). </p>
<p>&quot;Re-utilisation&quot; – means any form of making available to the public all<br/>
or a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by<br/>
renting, by online or other forms of transmission.</p>
<p>&quot;Substantial&quot; – Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a<br/>
combination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or<br/>
Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the<br/>
Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.</p>
<p>&quot;Use&quot; – As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright<br/>
or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and<br/>
includes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing,<br/>
publicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as<br/>
well as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it<br/>
in a different mode or format. </p>
<p>&quot;You&quot; – Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not<br/>
previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the<br/>
Database, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to<br/>
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.</p>
<p>Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.</p>
<p>### 2.0 What this License covers</p>
<p>2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:</p>
<p>  a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;</p>
<p>  b. A license of the Database Right; and</p>
<p>  c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.</p>
<p>2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the<br/>
Database, including:</p>
<p>  a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.<br/>
  The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the<br/>
  Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents<br/>
  independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright<br/>
  law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database<br/>
  model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation<br/>
  of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table<br/>
  indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of<br/>
  Contents stored in the Database;</p>
<p>  b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and<br/>
  Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.<br/>
  Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the<br/>
  Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed<br/>
  from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would<br/>
  not infringe any applicable copyright; and</p>
<p>  c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for<br/>
  access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of<br/>
  use on this access as outlined in this License. </p>
<p>2.3 Rights not covered. </p>
<p>  a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making<br/>
  or operation of the Database; </p>
<p>  b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the<br/>
  Database; and</p>
<p>  c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the<br/>
  Database. </p>
<p>2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of<br/>
the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,<br/>
including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality<br/>
rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database<br/>
Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.<br/>
For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this<br/>
License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could<br/>
have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of<br/>
the rights over the images.  </p>
<p>### 3.0 Rights granted</p>
<p>3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor<br/>
grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but<br/>
only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of<br/>
any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly<br/>
include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To<br/>
the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be<br/>
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the<br/>
future. </p>
<p>The rights granted cover, for example:</p>
<p>  a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of<br/>
  the Contents;</p>
<p>  b. Creation of Derivative Databases;</p>
<p>  c. Creation of Collective Databases;</p>
<p>  d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and<br/>
  in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative<br/>
  Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and</p>
<p>  e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or<br/>
  performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in<br/>
  part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective<br/>
  Databases.</p>
<p>3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:</p>
<p>  a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br/>
  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br/>
  compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves<br/>
  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You<br/>
  of the rights granted under this License;</p>
<p>  b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br/>
  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br/>
  compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the<br/>
  exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of<br/>
  the rights granted under this License; and,</p>
<p>  c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect<br/>
  royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is<br/>
  a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing<br/>
  schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights<br/>
  granted under this License.</p>
<p>3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop<br/>
distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that<br/>
this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice<br/>
of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section<br/>
10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.</p>
<p>### 4.0 Conditions of Use</p>
<p>4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to<br/>
Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important<br/>
conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be<br/>
in material breach of its terms.</p>
<p>4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative<br/>
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You<br/>
must: </p>
<p>  a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license<br/>
  permitted under Section 4.4;</p>
<p>  b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license<br/>
  permitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)<br/>
  with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the<br/>
  Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and</p>
<p>  c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices<br/>
  that refer to this License.</p>
<p>  d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular<br/>
  file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a<br/>
  location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to<br/>
  look for it.</p>
<p>4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced<br/>
Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you<br/>
Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with<br/>
the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,<br/>
views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced<br/>
Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative<br/>
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it<br/>
is available under this License.</p>
<p>  a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under<br/>
  Section 4.3:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available<br/>
        here under the Open Database License (ODbL).</p>
<p>DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a<br/>
hyperlink to the URI of the Database. &quot;Open Database License&quot; should<br/>
contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If<br/>
hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the<br/>
required URI&apos;s with the above notice.</p>
<p>4.4 Share alike. </p>
<p>  a. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under<br/>
  the terms of: </p>
<p>    i. This License;</p>
<p>    ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this<br/>
      License; or</p>
<p>    iii. A compatible license. </p>
<p>  If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses<br/>
  mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license. </p>
<p>  b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the<br/>
  whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a<br/>
  Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4. </p>
<p>  c. Derivative Databases and Produced Works.  A Derivative Database is<br/>
  Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work<br/>
  created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.</p>
<p>  d. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt,<br/>
  You must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a<br/>
  that are incompatible with the rights granted under this License. </p>
<p>  e. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine<br/>
  compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the<br/>
  authorised proxy&apos;s public statement of acceptance of a compatible<br/>
  license grants You permission to use the compatible license.</p>
<p><br/>
4.5 Limits of Share Alike.  The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply<br/>
in the following:</p>
<p>  a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license<br/>
  Collective Databases under this License if You incorporate this<br/>
  Database or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License<br/>
  still applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of<br/>
  the Collective Database; </p>
<p>  b. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as<br/>
  part of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not<br/>
  create a Derivative Database for purposes of  Section 4.4; and</p>
<p>  c. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is<br/>
  not to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements<br/>
  of Section 4.4.</p>
<p>4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative<br/>
Database or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also<br/>
offer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy<br/>
in a machine readable form of:</p>
<p>  a. The entire Derivative Database; or</p>
<p>  b. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or<br/>
  the method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an<br/>
  algorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the<br/>
  differences between the Database and the Derivative Database.</p>
<p>The Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be<br/>
available at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical<br/>
distributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.</p>
<p>4.7 Technological measures and additional terms</p>
<p>  a. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to<br/>
  Section 4.7 b.)  any terms or any technological measures on the<br/>
  Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of<br/>
  the Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any<br/>
  rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting<br/>
  the ability of any person to exercise those rights.</p>
<p>  b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological<br/>
  measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a<br/>
  Substantial part of the Contents (a &quot;Restricted Database&quot;) in<br/>
  contravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the<br/>
  Database or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the<br/>
  Restricted Database:</p>
<p>    i. That is available without additional fee;</p>
<p>    ii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict<br/>
    the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have<br/>
    the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to<br/>
    exercise those rights (an &quot;Unrestricted Database&quot;); and</p>
<p>    iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the<br/>
    recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.</p>
<p>  c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a<br/>
  Derivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a<br/>
  password, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You<br/>
  do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights<br/>
  granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the<br/>
  ability of any person to exercise those rights. </p>
<p>4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time<br/>
You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the<br/>
Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the<br/>
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same<br/>
terms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for<br/>
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may<br/>
enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are<br/>
solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made<br/>
by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any<br/>
further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed<br/>
under this License.</p>
<p>### 5.0 Moral rights</p>
<p>5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights<br/>
to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment<br/>
that would otherwise prejudice the author&apos;s honour and reputation, or<br/>
any other derogatory treatment:</p>
<p>  a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives<br/>
  all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest<br/>
  extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section<br/>
  10.4; </p>
<p>  b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant<br/>
  jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral<br/>
  rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the<br/>
  fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under<br/>
  Section 10.4; and</p>
<p>  c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert<br/>
  moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their<br/>
  moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.</p>
<p>Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral<br/>
rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some<br/>
jurisdictions.</p>
<p>### 6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected </p>
<p>6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may<br/>
independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this<br/>
Database, including without limitation:</p>
<p>  a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents<br/>
  from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for<br/>
  purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and<br/>
  Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative<br/>
  or judicial procedure. </p>
<p>  b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation<br/>
  or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws. </p>
<p>6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract<br/>
and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated<br/>
quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including<br/>
creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the<br/>
Contents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or<br/>
Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount<br/>
to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the<br/>
Contents.</p>
<p>### 7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer</p>
<p>7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor &quot;as is&quot; and without any<br/>
warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,<br/>
custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically<br/>
disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,<br/>
non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of<br/>
errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.<br/>
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so<br/>
this exclusion may not apply to You.</p>
<p>### 8.0 Limitation of liability</p>
<p>8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,<br/>
the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability<br/>
for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use<br/>
under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused<br/>
by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of<br/>
liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,<br/>
consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,<br/>
data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies<br/>
even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such<br/>
damages.</p>
<p>8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and<br/>
direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on<br/>
the part of the Licensor.</p>
<p>### 9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License</p>
<p>9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License<br/>
automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without<br/>
notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the<br/>
Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative<br/>
Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You<br/>
under this License will not have their licenses terminated provided<br/>
their use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted<br/>
under Section 4.8 of this License.  Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will<br/>
survive any termination of this License.</p>
<p>9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor<br/>
will not terminate Your rights under it. </p>
<p>9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You<br/>
for the duration of applicable rights in the Database. </p>
<p>9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and<br/>
conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License<br/>
will be reinstated:</p>
<p>  a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th<br/>
  day after cessation of breach; </p>
<p>  b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless<br/>
  otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or</p>
<p>  c.  Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the<br/>
  violation, this is the first time You have received notice of<br/>
  violation of this License from  the Licensor, and You cure the<br/>
  violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Persons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to<br/>
be a recipient and receive a license under Section 4.8.</p>
<p>9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release<br/>
the Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or<br/>
making available the Database. Releasing the Database under different<br/>
license terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not<br/>
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is<br/>
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this<br/>
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as<br/>
stated above.</p>
<p>### 10.0 General</p>
<p>10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or<br/>
unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of<br/>
the remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each<br/>
remaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the<br/>
fullest extent permitted by law. </p>
<p>10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with<br/>
respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any<br/>
earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to<br/>
the Database. </p>
<p>10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be<br/>
entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any<br/>
breach by the Licensor. </p>
<p>10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by<br/>
the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are<br/>
sought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under<br/>
applicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant<br/>
jurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License,<br/>
these additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the<br/>
terms of this License.</p>

<div property="spdx:licenseTemplate" class="license-template">## ODC Open Database License (ODbL)
<p>### Preamble</p>
<p>The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to<br/>
allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while<br/>
maintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by<br/>
copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some<br/>
jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that<br/>
cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally,<br/>
the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to<br/>
act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.</p>
<p>Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,<br/>
audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),<br/>
and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the<br/>
contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL<br/>
together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a<br/>
single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the<br/>
contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should<br/>
describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual<br/>
record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply. </p>
<p>Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be<br/>
covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,<br/>
trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights<br/>
over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may<br/>
have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing<br/>
activities not covered by this License.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>The Licensor (as defined below) </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>You (as defined below) </p>
<p>agree as follows: </p>
<p>### 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words</p>
<p>&quot;Collective Database&quot; – Means this Database in unmodified form as part<br/>
of a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are<br/>
assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective<br/>
Database will not be considered a Derivative Database.</p>
<p>&quot;Convey&quot; – As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database,<br/>
or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables<br/>
a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative<br/>
Database.  Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a<br/>
computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no<br/>
transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.<br/>
&quot;Contents&quot; – The contents of this Database, which includes the<br/>
information, independent works, or other material collected into the<br/>
Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual<br/>
data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.</p>
<p>&quot;Database&quot; – A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a<br/>
systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic<br/>
or other means offered under the terms of this License.</p>
<p>&quot;Database Directive&quot; – Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European<br/>
Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection<br/>
of databases, as amended or succeeded.</p>
<p>&quot;Database Right&quot; – Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (&quot;sui<br/>
generis&quot;) rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed<br/>
by member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of<br/>
the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar<br/>
rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4. </p>
<p>&quot;Derivative Database&quot; – Means a database based upon the Database, and<br/>
includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any<br/>
other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the<br/>
Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or<br/>
Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new<br/>
Database.</p>
<p>&quot;Extraction&quot; – Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a<br/>
Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in<br/>
any form.</p>
<p>&quot;License&quot; – Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights<br/>
such as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.</p>
<p>&quot;Licensor&quot; – Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms<br/>
of this License. </p>
<p>&quot;Person&quot; – Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons<br/>
corporate or incorporate.</p>
<p>&quot;Produced Work&quot; –  a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text,<br/>
or sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the<br/>
Contents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative<br/>
Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.  </p>
<p>&quot;Publicly&quot; – means to Persons other than You or under Your control by<br/>
either more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their<br/>
activities (such as contracting with an independent consultant). </p>
<p>&quot;Re-utilisation&quot; – means any form of making available to the public all<br/>
or a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by<br/>
renting, by online or other forms of transmission.</p>
<p>&quot;Substantial&quot; – Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a<br/>
combination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or<br/>
Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the<br/>
Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.</p>
<p>&quot;Use&quot; – As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright<br/>
or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and<br/>
includes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing,<br/>
publicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as<br/>
well as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it<br/>
in a different mode or format. </p>
<p>&quot;You&quot; – Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not<br/>
previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the<br/>
Database, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to<br/>
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.</p>
<p>Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.</p>
<p>### 2.0 What this License covers</p>
<p>2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:</p>
<p>  a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;</p>
<p>  b. A license of the Database Right; and</p>
<p>  c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.</p>
<p>2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the<br/>
Database, including:</p>
<p>  a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.<br/>
  The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the<br/>
  Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents<br/>
  independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright<br/>
  law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database<br/>
  model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation<br/>
  of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table<br/>
  indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of<br/>
  Contents stored in the Database;</p>
<p>  b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and<br/>
  Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.<br/>
  Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the<br/>
  Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed<br/>
  from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would<br/>
  not infringe any applicable copyright; and</p>
<p>  c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for<br/>
  access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of<br/>
  use on this access as outlined in this License. </p>
<p>2.3 Rights not covered. </p>
<p>  a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making<br/>
  or operation of the Database; </p>
<p>  b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the<br/>
  Database; and</p>
<p>  c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the<br/>
  Database. </p>
<p>2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of<br/>
the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,<br/>
including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality<br/>
rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database<br/>
Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.<br/>
For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this<br/>
License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could<br/>
have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of<br/>
the rights over the images.  </p>
<p>### 3.0 Rights granted</p>
<p>3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor<br/>
grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but<br/>
only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of<br/>
any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly<br/>
include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To<br/>
the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be<br/>
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the<br/>
future. </p>
<p>The rights granted cover, for example:</p>
<p>  a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of<br/>
  the Contents;</p>
<p>  b. Creation of Derivative Databases;</p>
<p>  c. Creation of Collective Databases;</p>
<p>  d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and<br/>
  in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative<br/>
  Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and</p>
<p>  e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or<br/>
  performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in<br/>
  part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective<br/>
  Databases.</p>
<p>3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:</p>
<p>  a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br/>
  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br/>
  compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves<br/>
  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You<br/>
  of the rights granted under this License;</p>
<p>  b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br/>
  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br/>
  compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the<br/>
  exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of<br/>
  the rights granted under this License; and,</p>
<p>  c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect<br/>
  royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is<br/>
  a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing<br/>
  schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights<br/>
  granted under this License.</p>
<p>3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop<br/>
distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that<br/>
this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice<br/>
of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section<br/>
10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.</p>
<p>### 4.0 Conditions of Use</p>
<p>4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to<br/>
Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important<br/>
conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be<br/>
in material breach of its terms.</p>
<p>4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative<br/>
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You<br/>
must: </p>
<p>  a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license<br/>
  permitted under Section 4.4;</p>
<p>  b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license<br/>
  permitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)<br/>
  with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the<br/>
  Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and</p>
<p>  c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices<br/>
  that refer to this License.</p>
<p>  d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular<br/>
  file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a<br/>
  location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to<br/>
  look for it.</p>
<p>4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced<br/>
Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you<br/>
Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with<br/>
the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,<br/>
views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced<br/>
Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative<br/>
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it<br/>
is available under this License.</p>
<p>  a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under<br/>
  Section 4.3:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available<br/>
        here under the Open Database License (ODbL).</p>
<p>DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a<br/>
hyperlink to the URI of the Database. &quot;Open Database License&quot; should<br/>
contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If<br/>
hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the<br/>
required URI&apos;s with the above notice.</p>
<p>4.4 Share alike. </p>
<p>  a. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under<br/>
  the terms of: </p>
<p>    i. This License;</p>
<p>    ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this<br/>
      License; or</p>
<p>    iii. A compatible license. </p>
<p>  If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses<br/>
  mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license. </p>
<p>  b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the<br/>
  whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a<br/>
  Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4. </p>
<p>  c. Derivative Databases and Produced Works.  A Derivative Database is<br/>
  Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work<br/>
  created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.</p>
<p>  d. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt,<br/>
  You must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a<br/>
  that are incompatible with the rights granted under this License. </p>
<p>  e. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine<br/>
  compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the<br/>
  authorised proxy&apos;s public statement of acceptance of a compatible<br/>
  license grants You permission to use the compatible license.</p>
<p><br/>
4.5 Limits of Share Alike.  The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply<br/>
in the following:</p>
<p>  a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license<br/>
  Collective Databases under this License if You incorporate this<br/>
  Database or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License<br/>
  still applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of<br/>
  the Collective Database; </p>
<p>  b. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as<br/>
  part of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not<br/>
  create a Derivative Database for purposes of  Section 4.4; and</p>
<p>  c. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is<br/>
  not to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements<br/>
  of Section 4.4.</p>
<p>4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative<br/>
Database or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also<br/>
offer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy<br/>
in a machine readable form of:</p>
<p>  a. The entire Derivative Database; or</p>
<p>  b. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or<br/>
  the method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an<br/>
  algorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the<br/>
  differences between the Database and the Derivative Database.</p>
<p>The Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be<br/>
available at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical<br/>
distributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.</p>
<p>4.7 Technological measures and additional terms</p>
<p>  a. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to<br/>
  Section 4.7 b.)  any terms or any technological measures on the<br/>
  Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of<br/>
  the Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any<br/>
  rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting<br/>
  the ability of any person to exercise those rights.</p>
<p>  b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological<br/>
  measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a<br/>
  Substantial part of the Contents (a &quot;Restricted Database&quot;) in<br/>
  contravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the<br/>
  Database or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the<br/>
  Restricted Database:</p>
<p>    i. That is available without additional fee;</p>
<p>    ii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict<br/>
    the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have<br/>
    the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to<br/>
    exercise those rights (an &quot;Unrestricted Database&quot;); and</p>
<p>    iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the<br/>
    recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.</p>
<p>  c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a<br/>
  Derivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a<br/>
  password, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You<br/>
  do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights<br/>
  granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the<br/>
  ability of any person to exercise those rights. </p>
<p>4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time<br/>
You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the<br/>
Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the<br/>
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same<br/>
terms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for<br/>
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may<br/>
enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are<br/>
solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made<br/>
by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any<br/>
further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed<br/>
under this License.</p>
<p>### 5.0 Moral rights</p>
<p>5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights<br/>
to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment<br/>
that would otherwise prejudice the author&apos;s honour and reputation, or<br/>
any other derogatory treatment:</p>
<p>  a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives<br/>
  all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest<br/>
  extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section<br/>
  10.4; </p>
<p>  b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant<br/>
  jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral<br/>
  rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the<br/>
  fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under<br/>
  Section 10.4; and</p>
<p>  c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert<br/>
  moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their<br/>
  moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.</p>
<p>Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral<br/>
rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some<br/>
jurisdictions.</p>
<p>### 6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected </p>
<p>6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may<br/>
independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this<br/>
Database, including without limitation:</p>
<p>  a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents<br/>
  from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for<br/>
  purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and<br/>
  Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative<br/>
  or judicial procedure. </p>
<p>  b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation<br/>
  or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws. </p>
<p>6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract<br/>
and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated<br/>
quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including<br/>
creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the<br/>
Contents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or<br/>
Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount<br/>
to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the<br/>
Contents.</p>
<p>### 7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer</p>
<p>7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor &quot;as is&quot; and without any<br/>
warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,<br/>
custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically<br/>
disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,<br/>
non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of<br/>
errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.<br/>
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so<br/>
this exclusion may not apply to You.</p>
<p>### 8.0 Limitation of liability</p>
<p>8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,<br/>
the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability<br/>
for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use<br/>
under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused<br/>
by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of<br/>
liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,<br/>
consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,<br/>
data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies<br/>
even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such<br/>
damages.</p>
<p>8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and<br/>
direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on<br/>
the part of the Licensor.</p>
<p>### 9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License</p>
<p>9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License<br/>
automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without<br/>
notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the<br/>
Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative<br/>
Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You<br/>
under this License will not have their licenses terminated provided<br/>
their use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted<br/>
under Section 4.8 of this License.  Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will<br/>
survive any termination of this License.</p>
<p>9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor<br/>
will not terminate Your rights under it. </p>
<p>9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You<br/>
for the duration of applicable rights in the Database. </p>
<p>9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and<br/>
conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License<br/>
will be reinstated:</p>
<p>  a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th<br/>
  day after cessation of breach; </p>
<p>  b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless<br/>
  otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or</p>
<p>  c.  Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the<br/>
  violation, this is the first time You have received notice of<br/>
  violation of this License from  the Licensor, and You cure the<br/>
  violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Persons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to<br/>
be a recipient and receive a license under Section 4.8.</p>
<p>9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release<br/>
the Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or<br/>
making available the Database. Releasing the Database under different<br/>
license terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not<br/>
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is<br/>
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this<br/>
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as<br/>
stated above.</p>
<p>### 10.0 General</p>
<p>10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or<br/>
unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of<br/>
the remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each<br/>
remaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the<br/>
fullest extent permitted by law. </p>
<p>10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with<br/>
respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any<br/>
earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to<br/>
the Database. </p>
<p>10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be<br/>
entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any<br/>
breach by the Licensor. </p>
<p>10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by<br/>
the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are<br/>
sought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under<br/>
applicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant<br/>
jurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License,<br/>
these additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the<br/>
terms of this License.</p></div> -->
