<p>CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE<br/>
LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DRAFT LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN<br/>
ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION<br/>
ON AN &quot;AS-IS&quot; BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE<br/>
INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM<br/>
ITS USE.</p>
<p>License</p>
<p>THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE<br/>
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;CCPL&quot; OR &quot;LICENSE&quot;). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY<br/>
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS<br/>
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.</p>
<p>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE<br/>
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE<br/>
RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS<br/>
AND CONDITIONS.</p>
<p>1. Definitions</p>
<p>a. &quot;Collective Work&quot; means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology<br/>
or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form,<br/>
along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and<br/>
independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.<br/>
A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a<br/>
Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.</p>
<p>b. &quot;Derivative Work&quot; means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work<br/>
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical<br/>
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,<br/>
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any<br/>
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,<br/>
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be<br/>
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.</p>
<p>c. &quot;Licensor&quot; means the individual or entity that offers the Work under<br/>
the terms of this License.</p>
<p>d. &quot;Original Author&quot; means the individual or entity who created the<br/>
Work.</p>
<p>e. &quot;Work&quot; means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the<br/>
terms of this License.</p>
<p>f. &quot;You&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this<br/>
License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with<br/>
respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the<br/>
Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous<br/>
violation.</p>
<p>2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,<br/>
limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other<br/>
limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under<br/>
copyright law or other applicable laws.</p>
<p>3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,<br/>
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,<br/>
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to<br/>
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:</p>
<p>a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more<br/>
Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the<br/>
Collective Works;</p>
<p>b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;</p>
<p>c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform<br/>
publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission<br/>
the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;</p>
<p>d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform<br/>
publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission<br/>
Derivative Works;</p>
<p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now<br/>
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make<br/>
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights<br/>
in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor<br/>
are hereby reserved.</p>
<p>4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly<br/>
made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:</p>
<p>a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly<br/>
digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You<br/>
must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this<br/>
License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,<br/>
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You<br/>
may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the<br/>
terms of this License or the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted<br/>
hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all<br/>
notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.<br/>
You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly<br/>
digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control<br/>
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of<br/>
this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in<br/>
a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart<br/>
from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If<br/>
You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to<br/>
the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to<br/>
such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a<br/>
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent<br/>
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such<br/>
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.</p>
<p>b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly<br/>
digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this<br/>
License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource<br/>
Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of each<br/>
Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or<br/>
publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the<br/>
Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the<br/>
recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep<br/>
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of<br/>
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,<br/>
or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological<br/>
measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent<br/>
with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the<br/>
Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not<br/>
require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be<br/>
made subject to the terms of this License.</p>
<p>c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly<br/>
digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works,<br/>
You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the<br/>
Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are<br/>
utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the<br/>
Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; in the<br/>
case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in<br/>
the Derivative Work (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original<br/>
Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;).<br/>
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,<br/>
however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a<br/>
minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship<br/>
credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other<br/>
comparable authorship credit.</p>
<p>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</p>
<p>a. By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor<br/>
represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor&apos;s knowledge after<br/>
reasonable inquiry:</p>
<p>i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the<br/>
license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights<br/>
granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any<br/>
royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments;</p>
<p>ii. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity<br/>
rights, common law rights or any other right of any third party or<br/>
constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to<br/>
any third party.</p>
<p>b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN<br/>
WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN &quot;AS<br/>
IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED<br/>
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR<br/>
ACCURACY OF THE WORK.</p>
<p>6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE<br/>
LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY<br/>
RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL<br/>
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,<br/>
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF<br/>
THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED<br/>
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p>7. Termination</p>
<p>a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br/>
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.<br/>
Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective<br/>
Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses<br/>
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full<br/>
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will<br/>
survive any termination of this License.</p>
<p>b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here<br/>
is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).<br/>
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the<br/>
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at<br/>
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to<br/>
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is<br/>
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this<br/>
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as<br/>
stated above.</p>
<p>8. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a<br/>
Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the<br/>
Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You<br/>
under this License.</p>
<p>b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative<br/>
Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on<br/>
the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this<br/>
License.</p>
<p>c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under<br/>
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of<br/>
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action<br/>
by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to<br/>
the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and<br/>
enforceable.</p>
<p>d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no<br/>
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing<br/>
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.</p>
<p>e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties<br/>
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,<br/>
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified<br/>
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may<br/>
appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified<br/>
without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.</p>
<p><br/>
Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty<br/>

liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages<br/>
whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,<br/>
incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this<br/>
license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative<br/>
Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it<br/>
shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.</p>
<p>Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work<br/>
is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark<br/>

Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at<br/>
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to<br/>
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is<br/>
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this<br/>
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as<br/>
stated above.</p>
<p>8. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a<br/>
Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the<br/>
Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You<br/>
under this License.</p>
<p>b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative<br/>
Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on<br/>
the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this<br/>
License.</p>
<p>c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under<br/>
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of<br/>
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action<br/>
by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to<br/>
the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and<br/>
enforceable.</p>
<p>d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no<br/>
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing<br/>
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.</p>
<p>e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties<br/>
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,<br/>
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified<br/>
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may<br/>
appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified<br/>
without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.</p>
<p><br/>
Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty<br/>
whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be<br/>
liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages<br/>
whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,<br/>
incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this<br/>
license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative<br/>
Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it<br/>
shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.</p>
<p>Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work<br/>
is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark<br/>
&quot;Creative Commons&quot; or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons<br/>
