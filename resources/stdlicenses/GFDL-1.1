                GNU Free Documentation License<br/>
                   Version 1.1, March 2000
<p> Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br/>
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p><br/>
0. PREAMBLE</p>
<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other<br/>
written document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone<br/>
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without<br/>
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,<br/>
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get<br/>
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for<br/>
modifications made by others.</p>
<p>This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative<br/>
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It<br/>
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft<br/>
license designed for free software.</p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free<br/>
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free<br/>
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the<br/>
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;<br/>
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or<br/>
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License<br/>
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p>
<p><br/>
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a<br/>
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed<br/>
under the terms of this License.  The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any<br/>
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is<br/>
addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>
<p>A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the<br/>
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with<br/>
modifications and/or translated into another language.</p>
<p>A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of<br/>
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the<br/>
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&apos;s overall subject<br/>
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly<br/>
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a<br/>
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any<br/>
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical<br/>
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,<br/>
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding<br/>
them.</p>
<p>The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles<br/>
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice<br/>
that says that the Document is released under this License.</p>
<p>The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,<br/>
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that<br/>
the Document is released under this License.</p>
<p>A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,<br/>
represented in a format whose specification is available to the<br/>
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and<br/>
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of<br/>
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available<br/>
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or<br/>
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input<br/>
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file<br/>
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage<br/>
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is<br/>
not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain<br/>
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML<br/>
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple<br/>
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include<br/>
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only<br/>
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or<br/>
processing tools are not generally available, and the<br/>
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output<br/>
purposes only.</p>
<p>The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,<br/>
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material<br/>
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in<br/>
formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means<br/>
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&apos;s title,<br/>
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</p>
<p><br/>
2. VERBATIM COPYING</p>
<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either<br/>
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the<br/>
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies<br/>
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other<br/>
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use<br/>
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further<br/>
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept<br/>
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough<br/>
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and<br/>
you may publicly display copies.</p>
<p><br/>
3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</p>
<p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,<br/>
and the Document&apos;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose<br/>
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover<br/>
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on<br/>
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify<br/>
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present<br/>
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and<br/>
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.<br/>
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve<br/>
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated<br/>
as verbatim copying in other respects.</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit<br/>
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit<br/>
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent<br/>
pages.</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering<br/>
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent<br/>
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy<br/>
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete<br/>
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the<br/>
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no<br/>
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter<br/>
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin<br/>
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this<br/>
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location<br/>
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque<br/>
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to<br/>
the public.</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the<br/>
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give<br/>
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</p>
<p><br/>
4. MODIFICATIONS</p>
<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under<br/>
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release<br/>
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified<br/>
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution<br/>
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy<br/>
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p>
<p>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct<br/>
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions<br/>
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section<br/>
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version<br/>
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.<br/>
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities<br/>
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified<br/>
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the<br/>
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).<br/>
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the<br/>
   Modified Version, as the publisher.<br/>
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.<br/>
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications<br/>
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.<br/>
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice<br/>
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the<br/>
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.<br/>
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections<br/>
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document&apos;s license notice.<br/>
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.<br/>
I. Preserve the section entitled &quot;History&quot;, and its title, and add to<br/>
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and<br/>
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If<br/>
   there is no section entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one<br/>
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as<br/>
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified<br/>
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.<br/>
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for<br/>
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise<br/>
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions<br/>
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section.<br/>
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at<br/>
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original<br/>
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.<br/>
K. In any section entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;,<br/>
   preserve the section&apos;s title, and preserve in the section all the<br/>
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements<br/>
   and/or dedications given therein.<br/>
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,<br/>
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers<br/>
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.<br/>
M. Delete any section entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.  Such a section<br/>
   may not be included in the Modified Version.<br/>
N. Do not retitle any existing section as &quot;Endorsements&quot;<br/>
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</p>
<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or<br/>
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material<br/>
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all<br/>
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the<br/>
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&apos;s license notice.<br/>
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</p>
<p>You may add a section entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains<br/>
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various<br/>
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has<br/>
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a<br/>
standard.</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a<br/>
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list<br/>
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of<br/>
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or<br/>
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already<br/>
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or<br/>
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,<br/>
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit<br/>
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License<br/>
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or<br/>
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p>
<p><br/>
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</p>
<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this<br/>
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified<br/>
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the<br/>
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and<br/>
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its<br/>
license notice.</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and<br/>
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single<br/>
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but<br/>
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by<br/>
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original<br/>
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.<br/>
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of<br/>
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled &quot;History&quot;<br/>
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled<br/>
&quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,<br/>
and any sections entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;.  You must delete all sections<br/>
entitled &quot;Endorsements.&quot;</p>
<p><br/>
6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</p>
<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents<br/>
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this<br/>
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in<br/>
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for<br/>
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute<br/>
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this<br/>
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all<br/>
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</p>
<p><br/>
7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</p>
<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate<br/>
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or<br/>
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version<br/>
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the<br/>
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an &quot;aggregate&quot;, and this<br/>
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled<br/>
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they<br/>
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these<br/>
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter<br/>
of the entire aggregate, the Document&apos;s Cover Texts may be placed on<br/>
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.<br/>
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.</p>
<p><br/>
8. TRANSLATION</p>
<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may<br/>
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.<br/>
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special<br/>
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include<br/>
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the<br/>
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a<br/>
translation of this License provided that you also include the<br/>
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement<br/>
between the translation and the original English version of this<br/>
License, the original English version will prevail.</p>
<p><br/>
9. TERMINATION</p>
<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except<br/>
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to<br/>
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will<br/>
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,<br/>
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this<br/>
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br/>
parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p><br/>
10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</p>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions<br/>
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new<br/>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br/>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See<br/>
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.<br/>
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this<br/>
License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of<br/>
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or<br/>
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the<br/>
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version<br/>
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not<br/>
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p><br/>
ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</p>
<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of<br/>
the License in the document and put the following copyright and<br/>
license notices just after the title page:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.<br/>
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document<br/>
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1<br/>
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;<br/>
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the<br/>
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.<br/>
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU<br/>
      Free Documentation License&quot;.</p>
<p>If you have no Invariant Sections, write &quot;with no Invariant Sections&quot;<br/>
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no<br/>
Front-Cover Texts, write &quot;no Front-Cover Texts&quot; instead of<br/>
&quot;Front-Cover Texts being LIST&quot;; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we<br/>
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of<br/>
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,<br/>
to permit their use in free software.</p>

modifications and/or translated into another language.</p>
<p>A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of<br/>
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the<br/>
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&apos;s overall subject<br/>
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly<br/>
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a<br/>
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any<br/>
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical<br/>
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,<br/>
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding<br/>
them.</p>
<p>The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles<br/>
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice<br/>
that says that the Document is released under this License.</p>
<p>The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,<br/>
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that<br/>
the Document is released under this License.</p>
<p>A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,<br/>
represented in a format whose specification is available to the<br/>
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and<br/>
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of<br/>
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available<br/>
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or<br/>
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input<br/>
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file<br/>
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage<br/>
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is<br/>
not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain<br/>
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML<br/>
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple<br/>
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include<br/>
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only<br/>
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or<br/>
processing tools are not generally available, and the<br/>
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output<br/>
purposes only.</p>
<p>The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,<br/>
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material<br/>
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in<br/>
formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means<br/>
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&apos;s title,<br/>
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</p>
<p><br/>
2. VERBATIM COPYING</p>
<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either<br/>
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the<br/>
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies<br/>
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other<br/>
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use<br/>
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further<br/>
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept<br/>
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough<br/>
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and<br/>
you may publicly display copies.</p>
<p><br/>
3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</p>
<p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,<br/>
and the Document&apos;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose<br/>
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover<br/>
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on<br/>
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify<br/>
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present<br/>
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and<br/>
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.<br/>
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve<br/>
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated<br/>
as verbatim copying in other respects.</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit<br/>
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit<br/>
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent<br/>
pages.</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering<br/>
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent<br/>
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy<br/>
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete<br/>
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the<br/>
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no<br/>
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter<br/>
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin<br/>
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this<br/>
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location<br/>
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque<br/>
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to<br/>
the public.</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the<br/>
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give<br/>
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</p>
<p><br/>
4. MODIFICATIONS</p>
<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under<br/>
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release<br/>
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified<br/>
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution<br/>
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy<br/>
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p>
<p>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct<br/>
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions<br/>
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section<br/>
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version<br/>
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.<br/>
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities<br/>
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified<br/>
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the<br/>
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).<br/>
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the<br/>
   Modified Version, as the publisher.<br/>
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.<br/>
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications<br/>
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.<br/>
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice<br/>
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the<br/>
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.<br/>
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections<br/>
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document&apos;s license notice.<br/>
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.<br/>
I. Preserve the section entitled &quot;History&quot;, and its title, and add to<br/>
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and<br/>
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If<br/>
   there is no section entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one<br/>
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as<br/>
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified<br/>
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.<br/>
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for<br/>
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise<br/>
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions<br/>
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section.<br/>
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at<br/>
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original<br/>
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.<br/>
K. In any section entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;,<br/>
   preserve the section&apos;s title, and preserve in the section all the<br/>
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements<br/>
   and/or dedications given therein.<br/>
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,<br/>
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers<br/>
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.<br/>
M. Delete any section entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.  Such a section<br/>
   may not be included in the Modified Version.<br/>
N. Do not retitle any existing section as &quot;Endorsements&quot;<br/>
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</p>
<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or<br/>
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material<br/>
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all<br/>
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the<br/>
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&apos;s license notice.<br/>
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</p>
<p>You may add a section entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains<br/>
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various<br/>
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has<br/>
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a<br/>
standard.</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a<br/>
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list<br/>
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of<br/>
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or<br/>
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already<br/>
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or<br/>
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,<br/>
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit<br/>
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License<br/>
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or<br/>
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p>
<p><br/>
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</p>
<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this<br/>
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified<br/>
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the<br/>
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and<br/>
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its<br/>
license notice.</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and<br/>
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single<br/>
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but<br/>
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by<br/>
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original<br/>
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.<br/>
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of<br/>
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled &quot;History&quot;<br/>
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled<br/>
&quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,<br/>
and any sections entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;.  You must delete all sections<br/>
entitled &quot;Endorsements.&quot;</p>
<p><br/>
6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</p>
<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents<br/>
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this<br/>
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in<br/>
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for<br/>
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute<br/>
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this<br/>
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all<br/>
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</p>
<p><br/>
7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</p>
<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate<br/>
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or<br/>
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version<br/>
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the<br/>
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an &quot;aggregate&quot;, and this<br/>
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled<br/>
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they<br/>
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these<br/>
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter<br/>
of the entire aggregate, the Document&apos;s Cover Texts may be placed on<br/>
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.<br/>
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.</p>
<p><br/>
8. TRANSLATION</p>
<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may<br/>
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.<br/>
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special<br/>
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include<br/>
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the<br/>
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a<br/>
translation of this License provided that you also include the<br/>
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement<br/>
between the translation and the original English version of this<br/>
License, the original English version will prevail.</p>
<p><br/>
9. TERMINATION</p>
<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except<br/>
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to<br/>
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will<br/>
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,<br/>
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this<br/>
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br/>
parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p><br/>
10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</p>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions<br/>
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new<br/>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br/>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See<br/>
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.<br/>
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this<br/>
License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of<br/>
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or<br/>
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the<br/>
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version<br/>
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not<br/>
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p><br/>
ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</p>
<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of<br/>
the License in the document and put the following copyright and<br/>
license notices just after the title page:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.<br/>
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document<br/>
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1<br/>
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;<br/>
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the<br/>
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.<br/>
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU<br/>
      Free Documentation License&quot;.</p>
<p>If you have no Invariant Sections, write &quot;with no Invariant Sections&quot;<br/>
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no<br/>
Front-Cover Texts, write &quot;no Front-Cover Texts&quot; instead of<br/>
&quot;Front-Cover Texts being LIST&quot;; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we<br/>
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of<br/>
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,<br/>
to permit their use in free software.</p></div> -->
