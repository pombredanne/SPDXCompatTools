        claims:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">               (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or<br/>
               trademark) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,<br/>
               sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions<br/>
               thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a<br/>

               to sell and import&apos;&apos;) the Original Code (or portions<br/>
               thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is<br/>
               reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original<br/>
               Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent<br/>
               that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or<br/>

               sell and import&apos;&apos;) the Contributor Version (or portions<br/>
               thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is<br/>
               reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the<br/>
               Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any<br/>
               greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further<br/>
               Modifications or combinations</p>
<p>3. Distribution Obligations.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        3.1. Application of License.<br/>
        The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are<br/>
        governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation<br/>
        Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be<br/>
        distributed only under the terms of this License or a future<br/>
        version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must<br/>
        include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code<br/>
        You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source<br/>
        Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of<br/>
        this License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder. However, You may<br/>
        include an additional document offering the additional rights<br/>
        described in Section 3.5.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br/>
        Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must<br/>
        be made available, prior to any use, except for internal<br/>
        development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of<br/>
        this License either on the same media as an Executable version or<br/>
        via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom<br/>
        you made an Executable version available; and if made available via<br/>
        Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at<br/>
        least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became<br/>
        available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of<br/>
        that particular Modification has been made available to such<br/>
        recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the<br/>
        Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact<br/>
        means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial<br/>
        Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may<br/>
        provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification<br/>
        to be made available.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        3.3. Description of Modifications.<br/>
        You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain<br/>
        a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code<br/>
        and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement<br/>
        that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from<br/>
        Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the<br/>
        name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in<br/>
        any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in<br/>
        which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">               (a) Third Party Claims.<br/>
               If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual<br/>
               property right in particular functionality or code (or its<br/>
               utilization under this License), you must include a text<br/>
               file with the source code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which<br/>
               describes the claim and the party making the claim in<br/>
               sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to<br/>
               contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your<br/>
               Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You<br/>
               shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make<br/>
               available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as<br/>
               notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)<br/>
               reasonably calculated to inform those who received the<br/>
               Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        (b) Representations.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">               Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to<br/>
               Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that<br/>
               Contributor&apos;s Modifications are Contributor&apos;s original<br/>
               creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to<br/>
               grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        3.5. Required Notices.<br/>
        You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the<br/>
        Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source<br/>
        Code, where You describe recipients&apos; rights relating to Covered<br/>
        Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your<br/>
        name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it<br/>
        is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file<br/>
        due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a<br/>
        location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be<br/>
        likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to<br/>
        charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br/>
        obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You<br/>
        may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial<br/>
        Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear<br/>
        that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation<br/>
        is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the<br/>
        Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred<br/>
        by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of<br/>
        warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br/>
        You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br/>
        requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered<br/>
        Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code<br/>
        version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this<br/>
        License, including a description of how and where You have<br/>
        fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be<br/>
        conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,<br/>
        related documentation or collateral in which You describe<br/>
        recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute<br/>
        the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your<br/>
        choice, which may contain terms different from this License,<br/>
        provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License<br/>
        and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to<br/>
        limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code version<br/>
        from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the<br/>
        Executable version under a different license You must make it<br/>
        absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are<br/>
        offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any<br/>
        Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer<br/>
        and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial<br/>
        Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You<br/>
        offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered<br/>
        Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the<br/>
        documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        3.7. Larger Works.<br/>
        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other<br/>
        code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the<br/>
        Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure<br/>
        the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered<br/>
        Code.</p>
<p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br/>
        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to<br/>
        statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of<br/>
        this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of<br/>
        the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully<br/>
        with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they<br/>
        affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file<br/>
        described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all<br/>
        distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited<br/>
        by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently<br/>
        detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand<br/>
        it.</p>
<p>5. Application of this License.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<br/>
        attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.</p>
<p>6. Versions of the License.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        6.1. New Versions.<br/>
        License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the<br/>
        License from time to time. Each version will be given a<br/>
        distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to<br/>
        opensource.org for certification.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br/>
        Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of<br/>
        the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of<br/>
        that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under<br/>
        the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by<br/>
        Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the<br/>
        right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under<br/>
        this License.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        6.3. Derivative Works.<br/>
        If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in<br/>
        association with the required Developer Specific License described<br/>
        in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code<br/>
        which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you<br/>
        must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open&apos;&apos;,<br/>
        ``OpenPL&apos;&apos;, ``OPL&apos;&apos; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear<br/>

        NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF<br/>
        THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE<br/>
        DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER<br/>
        CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR<br/>
        CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART<br/>
        OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER<br/>
        EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        8.1 Termination upon Breach</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br/>
        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br/>
        such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.  All<br/>
        sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall<br/>
        survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their<br/>
        nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<br/>
        shall survive.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">         </p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        8.2.  Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by<br/>
        asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment<br/>
        actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial<br/>
        Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred<br/>
        to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">               (a) such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or<br/>
               indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights<br/>
               granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or<br/>
               2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant<br/>
               terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt<br/>
               of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a<br/>
               mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future<br/>
               use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw<br/>
               Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version<br/>
               against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a<br/>
               reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually<br/>
               agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim<br/>
               is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You<br/>
               under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the<br/>
               expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">               (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such<br/>
               Participant&apos;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly<br/>
               infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such<br/>
               Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked<br/>
               effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,<br/>
               distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that<br/>
               Participant.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant<br/>
        alleging that such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or<br/>
        indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as<br/>
        by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent<br/>
        infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses<br/>
        granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken<br/>
        into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or<br/>
        license.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all<br/>
        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)<br/>
        which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder<br/>
        prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">         </p>
<p>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<br/>
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL<br/>
        DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,<br/>
        OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER<br/>
        PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES<br/>
        OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF<br/>
        GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND<br/>
        ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE<br/>
        BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF<br/>
        LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<br/>
        RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW<br/>
        PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br/>
        EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO<br/>
        THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,&apos;&apos; as that term is defined in<br/>
        48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct.  1995), consisting of ``commercial computer<br/>
        software&apos;&apos; and ``commercial computer software documentation,&apos;&apos; as such<br/>
        terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48<br/>
        C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),<br/>
        all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those<br/>

        The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are<br/>
        governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation<br/>
        Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be<br/>
        distributed only under the terms of this License or a future<br/>
        version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must<br/>
        include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code<br/>
        You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source<br/>
        Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of<br/>
        this License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder. However, You may<br/>
        include an additional document offering the additional rights<br/>
        described in Section 3.5.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br/>

        be made available, prior to any use, except for internal<br/>
        development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of<br/>
        this License either on the same media as an Executable version or<br/>
        via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom<br/>
        you made an Executable version available; and if made available via<br/>
        Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at<br/>
        least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became<br/>
        available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of<br/>
        that particular Modification has been made available to such<br/>
        recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the<br/>
        Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact<br/>
        means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial<br/>
        Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may<br/>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        3.3. Description of Modifications.<br/>
        You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain<br/>

        and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement<br/>
        that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from<br/>
        Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the<br/>
        name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in<br/>
        any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in<br/>
        which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">               (a) Third Party Claims.<br/>
               If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual<br/>
               property right in particular functionality or code (or its<br/>
               utilization under this License), you must include a text<br/>
               file with the source code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which<br/>
               describes the claim and the party making the claim in<br/>
               sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to<br/>
               contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your<br/>
               Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You<br/>
               shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make<br/>
               available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as<br/>
               notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)<br/>
               reasonably calculated to inform those who received the<br/>
               Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">               Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to<br/>
               Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that<br/>
               Contributor&apos;s Modifications are Contributor&apos;s original<br/>
               creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to<br/>
               grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        3.5. Required Notices.<br/>
        You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the<br/>
        Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source<br/>
        Code, where You describe recipients&apos; rights relating to Covered<br/>
        Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your<br/>
        name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it<br/>
        is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file<br/>
        due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a<br/>
        location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be<br/>
        likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to<br/>
        charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br/>
        obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You<br/>
        may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial<br/>
        Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear<br/>
        that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation<br/>
        is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the<br/>
        Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred<br/>
        by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of<br/>
        warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br/>
        You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br/>
        requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered<br/>
        Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code<br/>
        version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this<br/>
        License, including a description of how and where You have<br/>
        fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be<br/>
        conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,<br/>
        related documentation or collateral in which You describe<br/>
        recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute<br/>
        the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your<br/>
        choice, which may contain terms different from this License,<br/>
        provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License<br/>
        and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to<br/>
        limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code version<br/>
        from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the<br/>
        Executable version under a different license You must make it<br/>
        absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are<br/>
        offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any<br/>
        Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer<br/>
        and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial<br/>
        Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You<br/>
        offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered<br/>
        Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the<br/>
        documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        3.7. Larger Works.<br/>
        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other<br/>
        code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the<br/>
        Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure<br/>
        the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered<br/>
        Code.</p>
<p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br/>
        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to<br/>
        statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of<br/>
        this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of<br/>
        the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully<br/>
        with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they<br/>
        affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file<br/>
        described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all<br/>
        distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited<br/>
        by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently<br/>
        detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand<br/>
        it.</p>
<p>5. Application of this License.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<br/>
        attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.</p>
<p>6. Versions of the License.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        6.1. New Versions.<br/>
        License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the<br/>
        License from time to time. Each version will be given a<br/>
        distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to<br/>
        opensource.org for certification.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br/>
        Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of<br/>
        the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of<br/>
        that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under<br/>
        the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by<br/>
        Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the<br/>
        right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under<br/>
        this License.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        6.3. Derivative Works.<br/>
        If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in<br/>
        association with the required Developer Specific License described<br/>
        in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code<br/>
        which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you<br/>
        must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open&apos;&apos;,<br/>
        ``OpenPL&apos;&apos;, ``OPL&apos;&apos; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear<br/>
        anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your<br/>
        version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open<br/>
        Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,<br/>
        Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A<br/>
        shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this<br/>
        License.)</p>
<p>6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        This license is a union of the following two parts that should be<br/>
        found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of<br/>
        preeminence:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">           [1] A Developer specific license.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">           [2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general<br/>
           licensing policy of the software.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license,<br/>
        the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by<br/>
        the terms of the higher numbered part.</p>
<p>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,<br/>
        WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br/>
        WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF<br/>
        DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR<br/>
        NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF<br/>
        THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE<br/>
        DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER<br/>
        CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR<br/>
        CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART<br/>
        OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER<br/>
        EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        8.1 Termination upon Breach</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br/>
        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br/>
        such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.  All<br/>
        sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall<br/>
        survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their<br/>
        nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<br/>
        shall survive.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">         </p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        8.2.  Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by<br/>
        asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment<br/>
        actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial<br/>
        Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred<br/>
        to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">               (a) such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or<br/>
               indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights<br/>
               granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or<br/>
               2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant<br/>
               terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt<br/>
               of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a<br/>
               mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future<br/>
               use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw<br/>
               Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version<br/>
               against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a<br/>
               reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually<br/>
               agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim<br/>
               is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You<br/>
               under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the<br/>
               expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">               (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such<br/>
               Participant&apos;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly<br/>
               infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such<br/>
               Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked<br/>
               effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,<br/>
               distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that<br/>
               Participant.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant<br/>
        alleging that such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or<br/>
        indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as<br/>
        by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent<br/>
        infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses<br/>
        granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken<br/>
        into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or<br/>
        license.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all<br/>
        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)<br/>
        which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder<br/>
        prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">         </p>
<p>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<br/>
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL<br/>
        DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,<br/>
        OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER<br/>
        PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES<br/>
        OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF<br/>
        GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND<br/>
        ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE<br/>
        BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF<br/>
        LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<br/>
        RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW<br/>
        PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br/>
        EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO<br/>
        THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,&apos;&apos; as that term is defined in<br/>
        48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct.  1995), consisting of ``commercial computer<br/>
        software&apos;&apos; and ``commercial computer software documentation,&apos;&apos; as such<br/>
        terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48<br/>
        C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),<br/>
        all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those<br/>
        rights set forth herein.</p>
<p>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        This section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this<br/>
        section are found in the corresponding addendum described above.</p>
<p>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">        Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with<br/>
        Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or<br/>
        indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License,<br/>
        based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the<br/>
        revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant<br/>
        factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with<br/>
        Initial Developer responsibility on an equitable basis.</p>
