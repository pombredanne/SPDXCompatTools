The Open Software License<br/>
v. 1.0
<p>This Open Software License (the &quot;License&quot;) applies to any original<br/>
work of authorship (the &quot;Original Work&quot;) whose owner (the &quot;Licensor&quot;)<br/>
has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright<br/>
notice for the Original Work: &quot;Licensed under the Open Software<br/>
License version 1.0&quot;</p>
<p>License Terms</p>
<p>1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a<br/>
world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable<br/>
license to do the following:</p>
<p>a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;</p>
<p>b) to prepare derivative works (&quot;Derivative Works&quot;) based upon the<br/>
Original Work;</p>
<p>c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works<br/>
to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or<br/>
Derivative Works that You distribute shall be licensed under the<br/>
Open Software License;</p>
<p>d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and</p>
<p>e) to display the Original Work publicly.</p>
<p>2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,<br/>
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable license,<br/>
under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are<br/>
embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor (&quot;Licensed<br/>
Claims&quot;) to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work.<br/>
Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,<br/>
perpetual, non-sublicenseable license under the Licensed Claims to<br/>
make, use, sell and offer for sale Derivative Works.</p>
<p>3) Grant of Source Code License. The term &quot;Source Code&quot; means the<br/>
preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and<br/>
all available documentation describing how to access and modify the<br/>
Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable<br/>
copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of<br/>
the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the<br/>
right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of<br/>
the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to<br/>
permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as<br/>
Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing<br/>
the address of that information repository in a notice immediately<br/>
following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.</p>
<p>4) Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be<br/>
deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade<br/>
secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as<br/>
expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use,<br/>
sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the<br/>
Licensed Claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the<br/>
trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original<br/>
Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit<br/>
Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any<br/>
Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.</p>
<p>5) External Deployment. The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the use<br/>
or distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way<br/>
such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be accessed or<br/>
used by anyone other than You, whether the Original Work or Derivative<br/>
Works are distributed to those persons, made available as an<br/>
application intended for use over a computer network, or used to<br/>
provide services or otherwise deliver content to anyone other than<br/>
You. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You<br/>
agree that any External Deployment by You shall be deemed a<br/>
distribution and shall be licensed to all under the terms of this<br/>
License, as prescribed in section 1(c) herein.</p>
<p>6) Warranty and Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSOR WARRANTS THAT THE<br/>
COPYRIGHT IN AND TO THE ORIGINAL WORK IS OWNED BY THE LICENSOR OR THAT<br/>
THE ORIGINAL WORK IS DISTRIBUTED BY LICENSOR UNDER A VALID CURRENT<br/>
LICENSE FROM THE COPYRIGHT OWNER. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE<br/>
IMMEDIATELY PRECEEDING SENTENCE, THE ORIGINAL WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER<br/>
THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR<br/>
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTY OF<br/>
NON-INFRINGEMENT AND WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL WORK IS MERCHANTABLE<br/>
OR FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF<br/>
THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES<br/>
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO LICENSE TO ORIGINAL WORK IS<br/>
GRANTED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>
<p>7) Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL<br/>
THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,<br/>
SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,<br/>
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING<br/>
AS A RESULT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE ORIGINAL WORK INCLUDING,<br/>
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,<br/>
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL<br/>
DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PERSON SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE<br/>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT<br/>
APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH<br/>
PARTY&apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH<br/>
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR<br/>
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION<br/>
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>8) Acceptance and Termination. Nothing else but this License (or<br/>
another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You<br/>
permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work,<br/>
and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or<br/>
another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly<br/>
prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other<br/>
countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any<br/>
of the rights granted to You in Sections 1 and 2 herein, You indicate<br/>
Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.<br/>
This license shall terminate immediately and you may no longer<br/>
exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon Your<br/>
failure to honor the proviso in Section 1(c) herein.</p>
<p>9) Mutual Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate<br/>
automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted<br/>
to You by this License if You file a lawsuit in any court alleging<br/>
that any OSI Certified open source software that is licensed under any<br/>
license containing this &quot;Mutual Termination for Patent Action&quot; clause<br/>
infringes any patent claims that are essential to use that software.</p>
<p>10) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. You agree that any lawsuit<br/>
arising under or relating to this License shall be maintained in the<br/>
courts of the jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which<br/>
Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that<br/>
jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application<br/>
of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International<br/>
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work<br/>
outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be<br/>
subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act,<br/>
17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and<br/>
international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of<br/>
this License.</p>
<p>11) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License<br/>
or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be<br/>
entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without<br/>
limitation, reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and costs incurred in<br/>
connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This<br/>
section shall survive the termination of this License.</p>
<p>12) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement<br/>
concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License<br/>
is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to<br/>
the extent necessary to make it enforceable.</p>
<p>13) Definition of &quot;You&quot; in This License. &quot;You&quot; throughout this<br/>
License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a<br/>
legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the<br/>
terms of, this License. For legal entities, &quot;You&quot; includes any entity<br/>
that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you.<br/>
For purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct<br/>
or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,<br/>
whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent<br/>
(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership<br/>
of such entity.</p>
<p>This license is Copyright (C) 2002 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights<br/>
reserved. Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this<br/>
license without modification. This license may not be modified without<br/>
the express written permission of its copyright owner.</p>
