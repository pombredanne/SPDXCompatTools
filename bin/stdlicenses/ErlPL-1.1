non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property<br/>
claims:</p>
<p>(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and<br/>
    distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without<br/>
    Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and </p>
<p>(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial<br/>
    Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize&apos;&apos;) the<br/>
    Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that<br/>
    any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize<br/>
    the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater<br/>
    extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or<br/>
    combinations. </p>
<p>2.2. Contributor Grant.<br/>
Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<br/>
non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property<br/>
claims:</p>
<p>(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and<br/>
    distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or<br/>
    portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other<br/>
    Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and </p>
<p>(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor,<br/>
    to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but<br/>
    solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary<br/>
    to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions<br/>
    thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to<br/>
    Utilize further Modifications or combinations. </p>
<p>3. Distribution Obligations.</p>
<p>3.1. Application of License.<br/>
The Modifications which You contribute are governed by the terms of<br/>
this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source<br/>
Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms<br/>
of this License, and You must include a copy of this License with<br/>
every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or<br/>
impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts<br/>
the applicable version of this License or the recipients&apos; rights<br/>
hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering<br/>
the additional rights described in Section 3.5. </p>
<p>3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br/>
Any Modification which You contribute must be made available in Source<br/>
Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as<br/>
an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution<br/>
Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;<br/>
and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must<br/>
remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it<br/>
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a<br/>
subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made<br/>
available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that<br/>
the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic<br/>
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.</p>
<p>3.3. Description of Modifications.<br/>
You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a<br/>
file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and<br/>
the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that<br/>
the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original<br/>
Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the<br/>
Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an<br/>
Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the<br/>
origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</p>
<p>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</p>
<p>(a) Third Party Claims.<br/>
    If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property<br/>
    right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization<br/>
    under this License), you must include a text file with the source<br/>
    code distribution titled ``LEGAL&apos;&apos; which describes the claim and<br/>
    the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient<br/>
    will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You<br/>
    make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You<br/>
    shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make<br/>
    available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying<br/>
    appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to<br/>
    inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has<br/>
    been obtained. </p>
<p>(b) Contributor APIs.<br/>
    If Your Modification is an application programming interface and<br/>
    You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to<br/>
    implement that API, you must also include this information in the<br/>
    LEGAL file. </p>
<p>3.5. Required Notices.<br/>
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source<br/>
Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where<br/>
You describe recipients&apos; rights relating to Covered Code. If You<br/>
created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a<br/>
Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not<br/>
possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to<br/>
its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such<br/>
as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for<br/>
such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,<br/>
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more<br/>
recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own<br/>
behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any<br/>
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,<br/>
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,<br/>
and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every<br/>
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or<br/>
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or<br/>
liability terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br/>
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br/>
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,<br/>
and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of<br/>
the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,<br/>
including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the<br/>
obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included<br/>
in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or<br/>
collateral in which You describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the<br/>
Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered<br/>
Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different<br/>
from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms<br/>
of this License and that the license for the Executable version does<br/>
not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source<br/>
Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You<br/>
distribute the Executable version under a different license You must<br/>
make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License<br/>
are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any<br/>
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and<br/>
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer<br/>
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.7. Larger Works.<br/>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code<br/>
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<br/>
Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the<br/>
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>
<p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br/>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br/>
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute<br/>
or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License<br/>
to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and<br/>
the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL<br/>
file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all<br/>
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by<br/>
statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed<br/>
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
<p>5. Application of this License.</p>
<p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<br/>
attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.</p>
<p>6. CONNECTION TO MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE</p>
<p>This Erlang License is a derivative work of the Mozilla Public<br/>
License, Version 1.0. It contains terms which differ from the Mozilla<br/>
Public License, Version 1.0.</p>
<p>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
<p>COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS&apos;&apos; BASIS,<br/>
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br/>
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF<br/>
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR<br/>
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF<br/>
THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE<br/>
IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER<br/>
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR<br/>
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART<br/>
OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER<br/>
EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION.<br/>
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br/>
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br/>
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All<br/>
sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall<br/>
survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their<br/>
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<br/>
shall survive.</p>
<p>9. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br/>
Any utilization of Covered Code shall not cause the Initial Developer<br/>
or any Contributor to be liable for any damages (neither direct nor<br/>
indirect).</p>
<p>10. MISCELLANEOUS<br/>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject<br/>
matter hereof. If any provision is held to be unenforceable, such<br/>
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it<br/>
enforceable. This License shall be construed by and in accordance with<br/>
the substantive laws of Sweden. Any dispute, controversy or claim<br/>
arising out of or relating to this License, or the breach, termination<br/>
or invalidity thereof, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction<br/>
of Swedish courts, with the Stockholm City Court as the first<br/>
instance.</p>

You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a<br/>
file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and<br/>
the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that<br/>
the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original<br/>
Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the<br/>
Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an<br/>
Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the<br/>
origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</p>
<p>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</p>
<p>(a) Third Party Claims.<br/>
    If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property<br/>
    right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization<br/>
    under this License), you must include a text file with the source<br/>
    code distribution titled ``LEGAL&apos;&apos; which describes the claim and<br/>
    the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient<br/>
    will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You<br/>
    make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You<br/>
    shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make<br/>
    available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying<br/>
    appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to<br/>
    inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has<br/>
    been obtained. </p>
<p>(b) Contributor APIs.<br/>
    If Your Modification is an application programming interface and<br/>
    You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to<br/>
    implement that API, you must also include this information in the<br/>
    LEGAL file. </p>
<p>3.5. Required Notices.<br/>
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source<br/>
Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where<br/>
You describe recipients&apos; rights relating to Covered Code. If You<br/>
created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a<br/>
Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not<br/>
possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to<br/>
its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such<br/>
as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for<br/>
such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,<br/>
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more<br/>
recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own<br/>
behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any<br/>
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,<br/>
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,<br/>
and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every<br/>
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or<br/>
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or<br/>
liability terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br/>
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br/>
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,<br/>
and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of<br/>
the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,<br/>
including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the<br/>
obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included<br/>
in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or<br/>
collateral in which You describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the<br/>
Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered<br/>
Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different<br/>
from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms<br/>
of this License and that the license for the Executable version does<br/>
not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source<br/>
Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You<br/>
distribute the Executable version under a different license You must<br/>
make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License<br/>
are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any<br/>
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and<br/>
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer<br/>
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.7. Larger Works.<br/>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code<br/>
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<br/>
Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the<br/>
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>
<p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br/>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br/>
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute<br/>
or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License<br/>
to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and<br/>
the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL<br/>
file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all<br/>
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by<br/>
statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed<br/>
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
<p>5. Application of this License.</p>
<p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<br/>
attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.</p>
<p>6. CONNECTION TO MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE</p>
<p>This Erlang License is a derivative work of the Mozilla Public<br/>
License, Version 1.0. It contains terms which differ from the Mozilla<br/>
Public License, Version 1.0.</p>
<p>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
<p>COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS&apos;&apos; BASIS,<br/>
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br/>
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF<br/>
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR<br/>
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF<br/>
THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE<br/>
IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER<br/>

CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART<br/>
OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER<br/>
EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION.<br/>
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br/>
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br/>
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All<br/>
sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall<br/>
survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their<br/>
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<br/>
shall survive.</p>
<p>9. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br/>
Any utilization of Covered Code shall not cause the Initial Developer<br/>
or any Contributor to be liable for any damages (neither direct nor<br/>
indirect).</p>
<p>10. MISCELLANEOUS<br/>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject<br/>
matter hereof. If any provision is held to be unenforceable, such<br/>
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it<br/>
enforceable. This License shall be construed by and in accordance with<br/>
the substantive laws of Sweden. Any dispute, controversy or claim<br/>
arising out of or relating to this License, or the breach, termination<br/>
or invalidity thereof, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction<br/>
of Swedish courts, with the Stockholm City Court as the first<br/>
instance.</p>
