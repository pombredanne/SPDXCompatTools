<p>This European Union Public Licence (the &quot;EUPL&quot;) applies to the Work or Software<br/>
(as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the<br/>
Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use<br/>
is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).</p>

defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright<br/>
notice for the Original Work:<br/>
	Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1<br/>
or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL.</p>

Code as the case may be.</p>

based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define<br/>

classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law<br/>
applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.</p>
<p>- The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works.</p>
<p>- The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most<br/>

disposal of any other natural or legal person.</p>
<p>2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence</p>
<p>The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable<br/>

- reproduce the Work,<br/>
- modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,<br/>

- distribute the Work or copies thereof,<br/>
- lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,<br/>
- sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.</p>
<p>Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now<br/>

<p>In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his<br/>
moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the<br/>
economic rights here above listed.</p>
<p>The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any<br/>
patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted<br/>
on the Work under this Licence.</p>
<p>3. Communication of the Source Code</p>
<p>The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable<br/>

Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright<br/>
notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely<br/>
accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the<br/>
Work.</p>
<p>4. Limitations on copyright</p>
<p>Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any<br/>
exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original<br/>
Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations<br/>
thereto.</p>
<p>5. Obligations of the Licensee</p>
<p>The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations<br/>
imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:</p>
<p>Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks<br/>
notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties.<br/>
The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with<br/>
every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must<br/>
cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been<br/>
modified and the date of modification.</p>
<p>Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the<br/>
Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution<br/>
and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later<br/>
version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under<br/>
this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose<br/>
any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or<br/>
restrict the terms of the Licence.</p>
<p>Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative<br/>
Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work<br/>
licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be<br/>
done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause,<br/>
&quot;Compatible Licence�&quot; refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this<br/>
Licence. Should the Licensee’s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict<br/>
with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence<br/>
shall prevail.</p>
<p>Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the<br/>
Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or<br/>
indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long<br/>
as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.</p>
<p>Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names,<br/>
trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for<br/>
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing<br/>
the content of the copyright notice.</p>
<p>6. Chain of Authorship</p>
<p>The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted<br/>
hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power<br/>
and authority to grant the Licence.</p>
<p>Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the<br/>
Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and<br/>
authority to grant the Licence.</p>
<p>Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors<br/>
grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this<br/>
Licence.</p>
<p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty</p>
<p>The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous<br/>
contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or &quot;bugs&quot;<br/>
inherent to this type of software development.</p>
<p>For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an &quot;as is&quot; basis and<br/>
without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation<br/>
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors,<br/>
accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as<br/>
stated in Article 6 of this Licence.</p>
<p>This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the<br/>
grant of any rights to the Work.</p>
<p>8. Disclaimer of Liability</p>
<p>Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural<br/>
persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or<br/>
moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work,<br/>
including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer<br/>
failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor<br/>
has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be<br/>
liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.</p>
<p>9. Additional agreements</p>
<p>While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to<br/>
conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,<br/>
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this<br/>
Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own<br/>
behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any<br/>
other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each<br/>
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such<br/>
Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
<p>10. Acceptance of the Licence</p>
<p>The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon &quot;I agree&quot;<br/>
placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by<br/>
affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable<br/>

Licence and all of its terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by<br/>

Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.</p>
<p>11. Information to the public</p>
<p>In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic<br/>
communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a<br/>
remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at<br/>
least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding<br/>
the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and<br/>
reproduced by the Licensee.</p>
<p>12. Termination of the Licence</p>
<p>The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any<br/>
breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.<br/>
Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the<br/>
Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full<br/>
compliance with the Licence.</p>
<p>13. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement<br/>
between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.</p>
<p>If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this<br/>
will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision<br/>
will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions<br/>
of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of<br/>
the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with<br/>
a unique version number.</p>
<p>All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have<br/>
identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.</p>

article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
<p>Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and<br/>
resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive<br/>
jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary<br/>
business.</p>
<p>15. Applicable Law</p>
<p>This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the<br/>
Licensor resides or has his registered office.</p>

registered office inside a European Union country.</p>

persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or<br/>
moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work,<br/>
including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer<br/>
failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor<br/>
has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be<br/>
liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.</p>
<p>9. Additional agreements</p>
<p>While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to<br/>
conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,<br/>
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this<br/>
Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own<br/>
behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any<br/>
other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each<br/>
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such<br/>
Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
<p>10. Acceptance of the Licence</p>
<p>The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon &quot;I agree&quot;<br/>
placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by<br/>
affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable<br/>
law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this<br/>
Licence and all of its terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by<br/>
exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of<br/>
the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or<br/>
Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.</p>
<p>11. Information to the public</p>
<p>In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic<br/>
communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a<br/>
remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at<br/>
least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding<br/>
the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and<br/>
reproduced by the Licensee.</p>
<p>12. Termination of the Licence</p>
<p>The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any<br/>
breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.<br/>
Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the<br/>
Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full<br/>
compliance with the Licence.</p>
<p>13. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement<br/>
between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.</p>
<p>If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this<br/>
will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision<br/>
will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions<br/>
of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of<br/>
the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with<br/>
a unique version number.</p>
<p>All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have<br/>
identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.</p>
<p>14. Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the<br/>
European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the<br/>
jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in<br/>
article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
<p>Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and<br/>
resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive<br/>
jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary<br/>
business.</p>
<p>15. Applicable Law</p>
<p>This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the<br/>
Licensor resides or has his registered office.</p>
<p>This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:</p>
<p>- a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any<br/>
Licensee;<br/>
- the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or<br/>
registered office inside a European Union country.</p>
