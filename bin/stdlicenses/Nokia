<p>2. SOURCE CODE LICENSE.</p>
<p>2.1 Nokia Grant.</p>
<p>Subject to the terms of this License, Nokia hereby grants You a world-wide,<br/>
royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual<br/>
property claims:</p>
<p>a) under copyrights Licensable by Nokia to use, reproduce, modify,<br/>
display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Software (or portions<br/>
thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work;</p>
<p>b) and under Patents Claims necessarily infringed by the making, using<br/>
or selling of Original Software, to make, have made, use, practice, sell,<br/>
and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Software (or<br/>
portions thereof).</p>
<p>c) The licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective<br/>
on the date Nokia first distributes Original Software under the terms of<br/>
this License.</p>
<p>d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted:<br/>
1) for code that You delete from the Original Software; 2) separate from<br/>
the Original Software; or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification<br/>
of the Original Software or ii) the combination of the Original Software<br/>
with other software or devices.</p>
<p>2.2 Contributor Grant.</p>
<p>Subject to the terms of this License and subject to third party intellectual<br/>
property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<br/>
non-exclusive license</p>
<p>a) under copyrights Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,<br/>
display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by<br/>
such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with<br/>
other Modifications, as Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work;<br/>
and</p>
<p>b) under Patent Claims necessarily infringed by the making, using,<br/>
or selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or<br/>
in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination),<br/>
to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose<br/>
of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and<br/>
2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor<br/>
Version (or portions of such combination).</p>
<p>c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective<br/>
on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Software.</p>
<p>d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted:<br/>
1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version;<br/>
2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by:<br/>
i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination<br/>
of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as<br/>
part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims<br/>
infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that<br/>
Contributor.</p>
<p>3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.</p>
<p>3.1 Application of License.</p>
<p><br/>
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed<br/>
by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.<br/>
The Source Code version of Covered Software may be distributed only under<br/>
the terms of this License or a future version of this License released<br/>
under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every<br/>
copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any<br/>
terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable<br/>
version of this License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder. However, You<br/>
may include an additional document offering the additional rights described<br/>
in Section 3.5.</p>
<p>3.2 Availability of Source Code.</p>
<p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be<br/>
made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either<br/>
on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic<br/>
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version<br/>
available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,<br/>
must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it<br/>
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent<br/>
version of that particular Modification has been made available to such<br/>
recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version<br/>
remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained<br/>
by a third party.</p>
<p>3.3 Description of Modifications.</p>
<p>You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain<br/>
a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software<br/>
and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that<br/>
the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software<br/>
provided by Nokia and including the name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code,<br/>
and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation<br/>
in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Software.</p>
<p>3.4  Intellectual Property Matters</p>
<p>(a) Third Party Claims.</p>
<p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&apos;s intellectual<br/>
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor<br/>
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the<br/>
Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&apos;&apos; which describes the claim and<br/>
the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know<br/>
whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification<br/>
is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly<br/>
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter<br/>
and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists<br/>
or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered<br/>
Software that new knowledge has been obtained.</p>
<p>(b) Contributor APIs.</p>
<p>If Contributor&apos;s Modifications include an application programming interface<br/>
and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary<br/>
to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in<br/>
the LEGAL file.</p>
<p>(c) Representations.</p>
<p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section<br/>
3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&apos;s Modifications are<br/>
Contributor&apos;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights<br/>
to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>
<p>3.5 Required Notices.</p>
<p>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source<br/>
Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code<br/>
file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location<br/>
(such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for<br/>
such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your<br/>
name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also<br/>
duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You<br/>
describe recipients&apos; rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Software.<br/>
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity<br/>
or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.<br/>
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia<br/>
or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,<br/>
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and<br/>
You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability<br/>
incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<br/>
indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.</p>
<p>You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the<br/>
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software,<br/>
and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the<br/>
Covered Software is available under the terms of this License, including<br/>
a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section<br/>
3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable<br/>
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&apos;<br/>
rights relating to the Covered Software. You may distribute the Executable<br/>
version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of Your<br/>
choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that<br/>
You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license<br/>
for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&apos;s<br/>
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.<br/>
If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You<br/>
must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License<br/>
are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any Contributor. You hereby agree<br/>
to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by<br/>
Nokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.7 Larger Works.</p>
<p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other<br/>
software not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<br/>
Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements<br/>
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.</p>
<p>4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.</p>
<p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br/>
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,<br/>
judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms<br/>
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations<br/>
and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL<br/>
file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions<br/>
of the Source Code.</p>
<p>Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description<br/>
must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able<br/>
to understand it.</p>
<p>5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.</p>
<p>This License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the notice<br/>
in Exhibit A and to related Covered Software.</p>
<p>6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.</p>
<p><br/>
6.1 New Versions.</p>
<p>Nokia may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time<br/>
to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.</p>
<p>6.2 Effect of New Versions.</p>
<p>Once Covered Software has been published under a particular version<br/>
of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that<br/>
version. You may also choose to use such Covered Software under the terms<br/>
of any subsequent version of the License published by Nokia. No one other<br/>
than Nokia has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Software<br/>
created under this License.</p>
<p>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
<p>COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&apos;&apos; BASIS,<br/>
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT<br/>
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE,<br/>
FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE<br/>
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY<br/>
COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT NOKIA, ITS LICENSORS<br/>
OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY<br/>
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF  WARRANTY CONSTITUTES<br/>
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED<br/>
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION.</p>
<p>8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically<br/>
if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within<br/>
30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered<br/>
Software which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this<br/>
License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond<br/>
the termination of this License shall survive.</p>
<p>8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim<br/>
(excluding declatory judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor (Nokia<br/>
or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;)<br/>
alleging that:</p>
<p>a) such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes<br/>
any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You<br/>
under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice<br/>
from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after<br/>
receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a<br/>
mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications<br/>
made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect<br/>
to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days<br/>
of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually<br/>
agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,<br/>
the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2<br/>
automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified<br/>
above.</p>
<p>b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&apos;s<br/>
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then<br/>
any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and<br/>
2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,<br/>
distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.</p>
<p>8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging<br/>
that such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes<br/>
any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)<br/>
prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable<br/>
value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or<br/>
2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any<br/>
payment or license.</p>
<p>8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all<br/>
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which<br/>
have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to<br/>
termination shall survive termination.</p>
<p>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING<br/>
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, NOKIA, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR,<br/>
OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH<br/>
PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,<br/>
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br/>
DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION,<br/>
OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL<br/>
HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION<br/>
OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<br/>
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS<br/>
SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION<br/>
OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT MAY ALLOW LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED;<br/>
IN SUCH CASES, A PARTY&apos;s, ITS EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES&apos; LIABILITY<br/>
SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S. $50. Nothing contained in this License shall prejudice<br/>
the statutory rights of any party dealing as a consumer.</p>
<p>10. MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter<br/>
hereof. All rights in the Covered Software not expressly granted under<br/>
this License are reserved. Nothing in this License shall grant You any<br/>
rights to use any of the trademarks of Nokia or any of its Affiliates,<br/>
even if any of such trademarks are included in any part of Covered Software<br/>
and/or documentation to it.</p>
<p>This License is governed by the laws of Finland excluding its conflict-of-law<br/>
provisions. All disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement shall<br/>
be settled by a single arbitrator appointed by the Central Chamber of Commerce<br/>
of Finland. The arbitration procedure shall take place in Helsinki, Finland<br/>
in the English language. If any part of this Agreement is found void and<br/>
unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement,<br/>
which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.</p>
<p>11. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>
<p>As between Nokia and the Contributors, each party is responsible for<br/>
claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization<br/>
of rights under this License and You agree to work with Nokia and Contributors<br/>
to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein<br/>
is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.</p>

property claims:</p>
<p>a) under copyrights Licensable by Nokia to use, reproduce, modify,<br/>
display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Software (or portions<br/>
thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work;</p>
<p>b) and under Patents Claims necessarily infringed by the making, using<br/>

and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Software (or<br/>
portions thereof).</p>
<p>c) The licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective<br/>

this License.</p>
<p>d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted:<br/>
1) for code that You delete from the Original Software; 2) separate from<br/>

of the Original Software or ii) the combination of the Original Software<br/>
with other software or devices.</p>
<p>2.2 Contributor Grant.</p>
<p>Subject to the terms of this License and subject to third party intellectual<br/>
property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<br/>
non-exclusive license</p>
<p>a) under copyrights Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,<br/>
display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by<br/>
such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with<br/>
other Modifications, as Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work;<br/>
and</p>
<p>b) under Patent Claims necessarily infringed by the making, using,<br/>
or selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or<br/>

Version (or portions of such combination).</p>
<p>c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective<br/>
on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Software.</p>
<p>d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted:<br/>
1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version;<br/>
2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by:<br/>

part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims<br/>
infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that<br/>
Contributor.</p>
<p>3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.</p>
<p>3.1 Application of License.</p>
<p><br/>
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed<br/>
by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.<br/>
The Source Code version of Covered Software may be distributed only under<br/>
the terms of this License or a future version of this License released<br/>
under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every<br/>
copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any<br/>
terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable<br/>
version of this License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder. However, You<br/>
may include an additional document offering the additional rights described<br/>
in Section 3.5.</p>
<p>3.2 Availability of Source Code.</p>
<p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be<br/>
made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either<br/>
on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic<br/>
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version<br/>
available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,<br/>
must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it<br/>
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent<br/>
version of that particular Modification has been made available to such<br/>
recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version<br/>
remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained<br/>
by a third party.</p>
<p>3.3 Description of Modifications.</p>
<p>You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain<br/>
a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software<br/>
and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that<br/>
the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software<br/>
provided by Nokia and including the name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code,<br/>
and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation<br/>
in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Software.</p>
<p>3.4  Intellectual Property Matters</p>
<p>(a) Third Party Claims.</p>
<p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&apos;s intellectual<br/>
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor<br/>
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the<br/>
Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&apos;&apos; which describes the claim and<br/>
the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know<br/>
whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification<br/>
is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly<br/>
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter<br/>
and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists<br/>
or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered<br/>
Software that new knowledge has been obtained.</p>
<p>(b) Contributor APIs.</p>
<p>If Contributor&apos;s Modifications include an application programming interface<br/>
and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary<br/>
to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in<br/>
the LEGAL file.</p>
<p>(c) Representations.</p>
<p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section<br/>
3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&apos;s Modifications are<br/>
Contributor&apos;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights<br/>
to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>
<p>3.5 Required Notices.</p>
<p>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source<br/>
Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code<br/>
file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location<br/>
(such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for<br/>
such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your<br/>
name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also<br/>
duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You<br/>
describe recipients&apos; rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Software.<br/>
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity<br/>
or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.<br/>
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia<br/>
or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,<br/>
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and<br/>
You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability<br/>
incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<br/>
indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.</p>
<p>You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the<br/>
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software,<br/>
and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the<br/>
Covered Software is available under the terms of this License, including<br/>
a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section<br/>
3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable<br/>
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&apos;<br/>
rights relating to the Covered Software. You may distribute the Executable<br/>
version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of Your<br/>
choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that<br/>
You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license<br/>
for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&apos;s<br/>
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.<br/>
If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You<br/>
must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License<br/>
are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any Contributor. You hereby agree<br/>
to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by<br/>
Nokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.7 Larger Works.</p>
<p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other<br/>
software not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<br/>
Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements<br/>
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.</p>
<p>4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.</p>
<p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br/>
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,<br/>
judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms<br/>
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations<br/>
and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL<br/>
file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions<br/>
of the Source Code.</p>
<p>Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description<br/>
must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able<br/>
to understand it.</p>
<p>5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.</p>
<p>This License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the notice<br/>
in Exhibit A and to related Covered Software.</p>
<p>6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.</p>
<p><br/>
6.1 New Versions.</p>
<p>Nokia may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time<br/>
to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.</p>
<p>6.2 Effect of New Versions.</p>
<p>Once Covered Software has been published under a particular version<br/>
of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that<br/>
version. You may also choose to use such Covered Software under the terms<br/>
of any subsequent version of the License published by Nokia. No one other<br/>
than Nokia has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Software<br/>
created under this License.</p>
<p>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
<p>COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&apos;&apos; BASIS,<br/>
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT<br/>
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE,<br/>
FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE<br/>
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY<br/>
COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT NOKIA, ITS LICENSORS<br/>
OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY<br/>
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF  WARRANTY CONSTITUTES<br/>
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED<br/>
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION.</p>
<p>8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically<br/>
if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within<br/>
30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered<br/>
Software which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this<br/>
License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond<br/>
the termination of this License shall survive.</p>
<p>8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim<br/>
(excluding declatory judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor (Nokia<br/>
or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;)<br/>
alleging that:</p>
<p>a) such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes<br/>
any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You<br/>
under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice<br/>
from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after<br/>
receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a<br/>
mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications<br/>
made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect<br/>
to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days<br/>
of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually<br/>
agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,<br/>
the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2<br/>
automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified<br/>
above.</p>
<p>b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&apos;s<br/>
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then<br/>
any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and<br/>
2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,<br/>
distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.</p>
<p>8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging<br/>
that such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes<br/>
any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)<br/>
prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable<br/>
value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or<br/>
2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any<br/>
payment or license.</p>
<p>8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all<br/>
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which<br/>
have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to<br/>
termination shall survive termination.</p>
<p>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING<br/>
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, NOKIA, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR,<br/>
OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH<br/>
PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,<br/>
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br/>
DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION,<br/>
OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL<br/>
HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION<br/>
OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<br/>
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS<br/>
SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION<br/>
OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT MAY ALLOW LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED;<br/>
IN SUCH CASES, A PARTY&apos;s, ITS EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES&apos; LIABILITY<br/>
SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S. $50. Nothing contained in this License shall prejudice<br/>
the statutory rights of any party dealing as a consumer.</p>
<p>10. MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter<br/>
hereof. All rights in the Covered Software not expressly granted under<br/>
this License are reserved. Nothing in this License shall grant You any<br/>
rights to use any of the trademarks of Nokia or any of its Affiliates,<br/>
even if any of such trademarks are included in any part of Covered Software<br/>
and/or documentation to it.</p>
<p>This License is governed by the laws of Finland excluding its conflict-of-law<br/>
provisions. All disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement shall<br/>
be settled by a single arbitrator appointed by the Central Chamber of Commerce<br/>
of Finland. The arbitration procedure shall take place in Helsinki, Finland<br/>
in the English language. If any part of this Agreement is found void and<br/>
unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement,<br/>
which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.</p>
<p>11. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>
<p>As between Nokia and the Contributors, each party is responsible for<br/>
claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization<br/>
of rights under this License and You agree to work with Nokia and Contributors<br/>
to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein<br/>
is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.</p>
