Notice<br/>
------</p>
<p><br/>
This Agreement is a free software license that is the result of  discussions<br/>
between its authors  in  order  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  two  main<br/>
principles guiding its drafting:<br/>
   - firstly, its conformity with French law, both as  regards  the  law  of<br/>
     torts and intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers<br/>
     to authors and the holders of economic rights over software.<br/>
   - secondly, compliance with the principles for the distribution  of  free<br/>
     software: access to source codes, extended user-rights.</p>
<p>The following bodies are the authors of this license CeCILL (Ce : CEA, C :<br/>
CNRS, I : INRIA, LL : Logiciel Libre):</p>
<p>Commissariat à l&apos;Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical  and<br/>
industrial establishment, having its principal place of  business  at  31-33<br/>
rue de la Fédération, 75752 PARIS cedex 15, France.</p>

<p><br/>
PREAMBLE<br/>
--------</p>
<p><br/>
The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users  the<br/>
right to modify and redistribute  the  software  governed  by  this  license<br/>
within the framework of an &quot;open source&quot; distribution model.</p>
<p>The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain  obligations  for<br/>
users  so  as  to  ensure  that  this  status  is  retained  for  subsequent<br/>
redistribution operations.</p>
<p>As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify<br/>
and redistribute granted by the license,  users are provided only with  a<br/>
limited warranty and  the software&apos;s author, the holder of the economic<br/>
rights,  and  the  successive licensors only have limited liability.</p>
<p>In this respect, it is brought to the user&apos;s attention that the risks<br/>
associated  with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing<br/>
the  software  by the user given its nature of Free Software,  that  may  <br/>
mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means <br/>
that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having<br/>
in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test<br/>
the Software&apos;s suitability  as  regards  their  requirements  in  conditions<br/>
enabling  the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more<br/>
generally,  to use and operate  it  in  the  same  conditions  of security.<br/>
This Agreement may be  freely  reproduced  and  published, provided  it  is<br/>
not altered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom. </p>
<p>This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of  the<br/>
economic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its provisions.</p>
<p><br/>

-----------------------------</p>
<p><br/>
7.1. Under no circumstances shall  the  Agreement  oblige  the  Licensor  to<br/>
provide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software.</p>
<p>However, the Licensor is entitled to offer  this  type  of  service. The<br/>
terms  and  conditions  of  such  technical  assistance,  and/or   such <br/>
maintenance, shall then be set forth in  a  separate  instrument.  Only  the<br/>
Licensor offering said  maintenance  and/or  technical  assistance  services<br/>
shall incur liability therefor.</p>
<p>7.2. Similarly, any or all Licensor  shall  be  entitled  to  offer  to  its<br/>
Licensees, under its own responsibility, a  warranty,  that  shall  only  be<br/>
binding upon itself, for the  redistribution  of  the  Software  and/or  the<br/>
Modified Software, under terms and conditions  that  it  shall  decide  upon<br/>
itself. Said warranty,  and  the  financial  terms  and  conditions  of  its<br/>
application, shall be subject to a separate instrument executed between  the<br/>
Licensor and the Licensee.</p>
<p><br/>
Article 8  - LIABILITY<br/>
----------------------</p>
<p><br/>
8.1. Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, should the Licensor  fail  to<br/>
fulfill all or part of its obligations  hereunder,  the  Licensee  shall  be<br/>
entitled to claim compensation for the direct loss suffered  as a result of<br/>
a fault on the part of the Licensor, subject to providing evidence of it. </p>
<p>8.2. The Licensor&apos;s liability is limited to the commitments made under  this<br/>
Licensing Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result ,  in  particular:<br/>
(i) of loss due the Licensee&apos;s total  or  partial  failure  to  fulfill  its<br/>
obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss due to the Software&apos;s use  or<br/>
performance that  is  suffered  by  the  Licensee,  when  the  latter  is  a<br/>
professional  using  said  Software  for  professional  purposes  and  (iii)<br/>
consequential loss due to the Software&apos;s use  or  performance.  The  Parties<br/>
expressly agree that any or all pecuniary or business  loss  (i.e.  loss  of<br/>
data, loss  of  profits,  operating  loss,  loss  of  customers  or  orders,<br/>
opportunity cost, any disturbance to business  activities)  or  any  or  all<br/>
legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a  third  party,  shall<br/>
constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement  to  any  or<br/>
all compensation from the Licensor.</p>
<p><br/>
Article 9  - WARRANTY<br/>
---------------------</p>
<p><br/>
9.1. The  Licensee  acknowledges  that  the  current  situation  as  regards<br/>
scientific and  technical  know-how  at  the  time  when  the  Software  was<br/>
distributed did not enable all possible uses to be tested and verified,  nor<br/>
for the presence of any or all faults to be detected. In this  respect,  the<br/>
Licensee&apos;s attention has been drawn to the risks  associated  with  loading,<br/>
using, modifying and/or developing and reproducing  the  Software  that  are<br/>
reserved for experienced users.</p>
<p>The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or  all  means,  the<br/>
product&apos;s suitability for its requirements, its due and proper  functioning,<br/>
and for ensuring that it  shall  not  cause  damage  to  either  persons  or<br/>
property.</p>
<p>9.2. The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is  entitled  to<br/>
grant all the rights on the  Software (including in  particular  the  rights<br/>
set forth in Article 5 hereof over the Software).</p>
<p>9.3. The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied &quot;as is&quot; by  the<br/>
Licensor without any or all other express  or  tacit  warranty,  other  than<br/>
that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in  particular,  without  any  or  all<br/>
warranty as to its market  value,  its  secured,  innovative  or  relevant<br/>
nature.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is  free  from<br/>
any or all error, that it shall  operate  continuously,  that  it  shall  be<br/>
compatible  with   the   Licensee&apos;s   own   equipment   and   its   software<br/>
configuration, nor that it shall meet the Licensee&apos;s requirements.</p>
<p>9.4. The Licensor does not either expressly  or  tacitly  warrant  that  the<br/>
Software does not  infringe  any  or  all  third  party  intellectual  right<br/>
relating to a patent, software or  to  any  or  all  other  property  right.<br/>
Moreover, the Licensor shall not hold the Licensee harmless against  any  or<br/>
all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in  respect  of  the<br/>
use, modification and redistribution of the Software.  Nevertheless,  should<br/>
such proceedings be instituted against  the  Licensee,  the  Licensor  shall<br/>
provide it with  technical  and  legal  assistance  for  its  defense.  Such<br/>
technical and legal assistance shall  be  decided  upon  on  a  case-by-case<br/>
basis  between  the  relevant  Licensor  and  the  Licensee  pursuant  to  a<br/>
memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any or all liability  as<br/>
regards the Licensee&apos;s use of the Software&apos;s  name.  No  warranty  shall  be<br/>
provided as regards the existence of prior  rights  over  the  name  of  the<br/>
Software and as regards the existence of a trademark.</p>
<p><br/>
Article 10  - TERMINATION<br/>
-------------------------</p>
<p><br/>
10.1. In  the  event  of  a  breach  by  the  Licensee  of  its  obligations<br/>
hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate  this  Agreement  thirty<br/>
(30) days after notice has been  sent  to  the  Licensee  and  has  remained<br/>
ineffective.</p>

its entitlement to invoke said provision(s) subsequently.</p>
<p>11.3. The Agreement cancels and replaces  any  or  all  previous  agreement,<br/>
whether written or oral, between the Parties and having  the  same  purpose,<br/>

PREAMBLE<br/>
--------</p>
<p><br/>
The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users  the<br/>
right to modify and redistribute  the  software  governed  by  this  license<br/>
within the framework of an &quot;open source&quot; distribution model.</p>
<p>The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain  obligations  for<br/>
users  so  as  to  ensure  that  this  status  is  retained  for  subsequent<br/>
redistribution operations.</p>
<p>As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify<br/>
and redistribute granted by the license,  users are provided only with  a<br/>
limited warranty and  the software&apos;s author, the holder of the economic<br/>
rights,  and  the  successive licensors only have limited liability.</p>
<p>In this respect, it is brought to the user&apos;s attention that the risks<br/>
associated  with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing<br/>
the  software  by the user given its nature of Free Software,  that  may  <br/>
mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means <br/>
that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having<br/>
in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test<br/>
the Software&apos;s suitability  as  regards  their  requirements  in  conditions<br/>
enabling  the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more<br/>
generally,  to use and operate  it  in  the  same  conditions  of security.<br/>
This Agreement may be  freely  reproduced  and  published, provided  it  is<br/>
not altered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom. </p>
<p>This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of  the<br/>
economic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its provisions.</p>

all compensation from the Licensor.</p>
<p><br/>
Article 9  - WARRANTY<br/>
---------------------</p>
<p><br/>
9.1. The  Licensee  acknowledges  that  the  current  situation  as  regards<br/>
scientific and  technical  know-how  at  the  time  when  the  Software  was<br/>
distributed did not enable all possible uses to be tested and verified,  nor<br/>
for the presence of any or all faults to be detected. In this  respect,  the<br/>
Licensee&apos;s attention has been drawn to the risks  associated  with  loading,<br/>
using, modifying and/or developing and reproducing  the  Software  that  are<br/>
reserved for experienced users.</p>
<p>The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or  all  means,  the<br/>
product&apos;s suitability for its requirements, its due and proper  functioning,<br/>
and for ensuring that it  shall  not  cause  damage  to  either  persons  or<br/>
property.</p>
<p>9.2. The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is  entitled  to<br/>
grant all the rights on the  Software (including in  particular  the  rights<br/>
set forth in Article 5 hereof over the Software).</p>
<p>9.3. The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied &quot;as is&quot; by  the<br/>
Licensor without any or all other express  or  tacit  warranty,  other  than<br/>
that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in  particular,  without  any  or  all<br/>
warranty as to its market  value,  its  secured,  innovative  or  relevant<br/>
nature.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is  free  from<br/>
any or all error, that it shall  operate  continuously,  that  it  shall  be<br/>
compatible  with   the   Licensee&apos;s   own   equipment   and   its   software<br/>
configuration, nor that it shall meet the Licensee&apos;s requirements.</p>
<p>9.4. The Licensor does not either expressly  or  tacitly  warrant  that  the<br/>
Software does not  infringe  any  or  all  third  party  intellectual  right<br/>
relating to a patent, software or  to  any  or  all  other  property  right.<br/>
Moreover, the Licensor shall not hold the Licensee harmless against  any  or<br/>
all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in  respect  of  the<br/>
use, modification and redistribution of the Software.  Nevertheless,  should<br/>
such proceedings be instituted against  the  Licensee,  the  Licensor  shall<br/>
provide it with  technical  and  legal  assistance  for  its  defense.  Such<br/>
technical and legal assistance shall  be  decided  upon  on  a  case-by-case<br/>
basis  between  the  relevant  Licensor  and  the  Licensee  pursuant  to  a<br/>
memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any or all liability  as<br/>
regards the Licensee&apos;s use of the Software&apos;s  name.  No  warranty  shall  be<br/>
provided as regards the existence of prior  rights  over  the  name  of  the<br/>
Software and as regards the existence of a trademark.</p>
<p><br/>
Article 10  - TERMINATION<br/>
-------------------------</p>
<p><br/>
10.1. In  the  event  of  a  breach  by  the  Licensee  of  its  obligations<br/>
hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate  this  Agreement  thirty<br/>
(30) days after notice has been  sent  to  the  Licensee  and  has  remained<br/>
ineffective.</p>
<p>10.2. The  Licensee  whose  Agreement  is  terminated  shall  no  longer  be<br/>
authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However,  any  or  all<br/>
licenses that it may have granted prior to  termination  of  the  Agreement<br/>
shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in  compliance  with<br/>
the terms and conditions hereof.</p>
<p><br/>
Article 11  - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS<br/>
--------------------------------------</p>
<p><br/>
11.1. EXCUSABLE EVENTS</p>
<p>Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or  failure  to  perform<br/>
the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event  of  force  majeure,  an<br/>
act of God or an outside cause, such as, notably, defective functioning,  or<br/>
interruptions affecting  the  electricity  or  telecommunications  networks,<br/>
blocking of the network following a virus attack, the  intervention  of  the<br/>
government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes,  fire,<br/>
explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.</p>
<p>11.2. The fact that either Party may fail, on one or several  occasions,  to<br/>
invoke  one  or  several  of  the  provisions   hereof,   shall   under   no<br/>
circumstances be interpreted as being a waiver by the  interested  Party  of<br/>
its entitlement to invoke said provision(s) subsequently.</p>
<p>11.3. The Agreement cancels and replaces  any  or  all  previous  agreement,<br/>
whether written or oral, between the Parties and having  the  same  purpose,<br/>
and  constitutes  the  entirety  of  the  agreement  between  said   Parties<br/>
concerning said purpose. No supplement or  modification  to  the  terms  and<br/>
conditions hereof shall be effective as regards the  Parties  unless  it  is<br/>
made in writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives.</p>
<p>11.4. In the event that one or several of  the  provisions  hereof  were  to<br/>
conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative  text,  said<br/>
act or legislative text shall take precedence, and the  Parties  shall  make<br/>
the necessary amendments so  as  to  be  in  compliance  with  said  act  or<br/>
legislative  text.  All  the  other  provisions  shall   remain   effective.<br/>
Similarly, the fact that a provision of  the  Agreement  may   be  null  and<br/>
void, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement  as  a  whole<br/>
to be null and void.</p>
<p>11.5. LANGUAGE</p>
<p>The Agreement is drafted in both French and  English.  In  the  event  of  a<br/>
conflict as  regards  construction,  the  French  version  shall  be  deemed<br/>
authentic.</p>
<p><br/>
Article 12  - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT<br/>
-------------------------------------------</p>
<p><br/>
12.1. Any or all person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies  of<br/>
this Agreement.</p>
<p>12.2. So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is  protected<br/>
and may only be modified by the authors of the  License,  that  reserve  the<br/>
right to periodically publish updates or  new  versions  of  the  Agreement,<br/>
each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may address new issues<br/>
encountered by Free Software.</p>
<p>12.3. Any  or  all  Software  distributed  under  a  given  version  of  the<br/>
Agreement may only be subsequently distributed under  the  same  version  of<br/>
the Agreement, or  a  subsequent  version,  subject  to  the  provisions  of<br/>
article 5.3.4.</p>
<p><br/>
Article 13 - GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION<br/>
-------------------------------------------</p>
<p><br/>
13.1. The Agreement is  governed  by  French  law.   The  Parties  agree  to<br/>
endeavor to settle the disagreements or disputes that may arise  during  the<br/>
performance of the Agreement out-of-court.</p>
<p>13.2. In the absence of an out-of-court settlement within two (2) months  as<br/>
from their occurrence, and unless emergency proceedings are  necessary,  the<br/>
disagreements or disputes shall be  referred  to  the  Paris  Courts  having<br/>
jurisdiction, by the first Party to take action.</p>
<p><br/>
